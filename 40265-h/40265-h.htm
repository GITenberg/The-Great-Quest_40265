<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="small">THE STRANGER</span></h3>

<p>One morning early in the summer of 1826, I brushed
the sweat from my forehead and the flour from my clothes,
unrolled my shirt-sleeves to my wrists, donned my coat,
and, with never a suspicion that that day was to be unlike
any other, calmly walked out into the slanting sunshine.
Rain had fallen in the night, and the air was still fresh
and cool. Although the clock had but just struck six, I
had been at work an hour, and now that my uncle, Seth
Upham, had come down to take charge of the store, I was
glad that some business discussed the evening before gave
me an excuse to go on an errand to the other end of the
village.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth looked up from his ledger as I passed. "You
are prompt to go," said he. "I've scarce got my hat on
the peg. Well, the sooner the better, I suppose. Young
Mackay's last shipment of oil was of poor quality and
color. The rascal needs a good wigging, but the best you
can do is tell the old man my opinion of his son's goods.
If he gets a notion that we're likely to go down to nine
cents a gallon on the next lot, he'll bring the boy to taw,
I'll warrant you. Well, be gone. The sooner you go, the
sooner you'll come, and we're like to have a busy day."</p>

<p>I nodded and went down the steps, but turned again
and looked back. As Uncle Seth sat at his desk just inside
the door, his bald head showing above the ledgers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he made me think of a pigeon-holed document concerned
with matters of trade&mdash;weights and measures, and dollars
and cents. He was a brisk, abrupt little man, with
keen eyes and a thin mouth, and lines that cut at sharp
angles into his forehead and drew testy curves around his
chin; and in his way he was prominent in the village.
Though ours was a community of Yankees, he had the
reputation, in which he took great pride, of being an uncommonly
sharp hand at a bargain. That it could be a
doubtful compliment, he never suspected.</p>

<p>He owned property in three towns besides our own village
of Topham; he kept a very considerable balance in a
Boston bank; he loaned money at interest from one end of
the county to the other, and he held shares in two schooners
and a bark&mdash;not to mention the bustling general
store that was the keystone of his prosperity.</p>

<p>If anyone had presumed so far as to suggest that a
close bargain could be aught but creditable, Uncle Seth
would have shot a testy glance at him, with some such
comment as, "Pooh! He's drunk or crazy!" And he
would then have atoned for any little trickery by his generosity,
come Sunday, when the offering was taken at
church.</p>

<p>There were, to be sure, those who said, by allusion or
implication, that he would beat the devil at his own game,
for all his pains to appear so downright honest. But they
were ne'er-do-weels and village scoundrels, whom Uncle
Seth, although he was said to have known them well
enough in early youth, passed without deigning to give
them so much as a nod; and of course no one believed the
word of such as they.</p>

<p>For my own part, I had only friendly feelings toward
him, for he was always a decent man, and since my
mother died, his odd bursts of generosity had touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
me not a little. Grumpy old Uncle Seth! Others might
call him "nigh," but for all his abrupt manner, he was
kind to me after a queer, short fashion, and many a bank-note
had whisked from his pocket to mine at moments
when a stranger would have thought him in furious
temper.</p>

<p>Turning on my heel, I left him busy at his desk amid
his barrels and cans and kegs and boxes, and unwittingly
set forth to meet the beginning of the wildest, maddest
adventure that I ever heard of outside the pages of
fiction.</p>

<p>As I went down past the church, the parsonage, and the
smithy,&mdash;the little group of buildings that, together with
our general store, formed the hub on which the life of the
country for many miles thereabouts revolved,&mdash;I was
surprised to see no one astir. Few country people then
were&mdash;or now are&mdash;so shameless as to lie in bed at six
o'clock of a summer morning.</p>

<p>By rights I should have heard the clank of metal, the
hum of voices, men calling to their horses, saws whining
through wood, and hammers driving nails. But there
was no sound of speech or labor; the nail-kegs on which
our village worthies habitually reposed during long intervals
of the working day were unoccupied; the fire in the
blacksmith's forge, for want of blowing, had died down
to a dull deep red. Three horses were tugging at their
halters inside the smithy, and a well-fed team was waiting
outside by a heavy cart; yet no one was anywhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>Perceiving all this from a distance, I was frankly puzzled;
and as I approached, I cast about with lively curiosity
to see what could cause so strange a state of affairs.
It was only when I had gone past the smithy, that I saw
the smith and his customers and his habitual guests gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
on the other side of the building, where I had not
been able to see them before. They were staring at the
old village tavern, which stood some distance away on a
gentle rise of land.</p>

<p>My curiosity so prevailed over my sense of duty that I
turned from the road through the tall grass, temporarily
abandoning my errand, and picked my way among some
old wheels and scrap iron to join the men.</p>

<p>Their talk only aggravated my wonder.</p>

<p>Clearing his throat, the smith gruffly muttered, "It
does act like him, and yet I can't believe it'll be him."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he come back?" one of the farmers
asked in a louder voice. "Things done twenty years
ago will never be dragged up to face him, and he'd know
that."</p>

<p>The smith grunted. "Where would Neil Gleazen find
the money to buy a suit of good clothes and a beaver hat?"</p>

<p>"That's easy answered," a third speaker put in. And
they all exchanged significant glances.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed I made bold to put a question
for myself. "Of whom are you talking?" I asked.</p>

<p>They looked closely at me and again exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"There's someone up yonder at the inn, Joe," the
smith said kindly; "and Ben, here, getting sight of him
last night and again this morning, has took a notion that
it's a fellow who used to live here years ago and who left
town&mdash;well, in a hurry. As to that, I can't be sure, but I
vum, I'd not be surprised if it was Neil Gleazen after all."</p>

<p>I now discerned in one of the rocking-chairs on the
porch the figure of a stranger, well dressed so far as we
could see at that distance, who wore a big beaver hat set
rakishly a trifle forward. He had thrust his thumbs into
the armholes of his waistcoat, and as he leaned back, with
his feet raised against one of the columns that supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the porch-roof, he sent clouds of white cigar-smoke eddying
up and away.</p>

<p>The others were so intent on their random speculations
that, when I asked more about who and what Neil Gleazen
was, they ignored my question, and continued to exchange
observations in low voices.</p>

<p>I could hear little of their talk without forcing myself
into their very midst, and of what little I heard I made
still less, for it was full of unfamiliar names and reminiscences
that meant nothing to me.</p>

<p>When some one spoke of Seth Upham, my mother's
brother, I was all ears on the instant; but I saw the smith
glance at me, and probably he nudged the speaker, for,
after a moment's pause, they went on about indifferent
matters. I then perceived that I was unlikely to learn
more, so I returned to the road and continued on my way.</p>

<p>As I passed the tavern I took occasion to see what I
could, in courtesy, of the stranger; but he looked so hard
at me while I was passing that I could steal only glances
at him, unless I gave him stare for stare, which I did not
wish to do. So I got only a brief glimpse of tall hat, bold
dark eyes under bushy brows, big nose, smooth-shaven
chin, and smiling mouth, all of which a heavy stock and
voluminous coat seemed to support. I thought that I
caught the flash of a jeweled pin in the man's stock and
of a ring on his finger, but of that I was not sure until
later. Pushing on, I left him in the old inn chair, as
proud as a sultan, puffing clouds of white smoke from a
long cigar and surveying the village as grandly as if he
owned it, while I went about my uncle's business at the
other end of the town.</p>

<p>But when I had gone far on my way, his dark face and
arrogant manner were still in my mind. While I was
arguing with surly old Dan Mackay about whale-oil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
horses and sugar and lumber, I was thinking of those
proud, keen eyes and that smiling, scornful mouth; while
I was bargaining with Mrs. Mackay for eggs and early
peas, I was thinking of the beaver that the man had
worn and the big ring on his finger; and while I was walking
back over two miles of country road, on which the
sun was now pouring down with ever-increasing heat, I
was thinking of how my uncle's name had popped out in
the conversation beside the smithy&mdash;and how it had
popped, so to speak, discreetly back again.</p>

<p>I was all eagerness, now, for another and better look at
the stranger, and was resolved to stare him out of countenance,
if need be, to get it. Imagine, then, my disappointment
when, hot and sweaty, I once more came in
sight of the tavern and saw the unmistakable figure under
the beaver hat walk jauntily down the steps, pause a
moment in the road, and, turning in the opposite direction,
go rapidly away from me.</p>

<p>The stranger should not escape me like that, I thought
with a grim chuckle; and warm though I was, I lengthened
my stride and drew slowly up on him.</p>

<p>As he passed the smithy, he looked to neither right nor
left, yet I was by no means sure that he did not see the
curious faces that filled the door when he went by. A
man can see so much without turning his head!</p>

<p>While I toiled on after him, trying to appear indifferent
and yet striving to overtake him before he should go
beyond the store, where I must turn in, would I or would
I not, he passed the church, the parsonage, and the schoolhouse.
He wore his hat tilted forward at just such an
angle, and to one side over his right eye; swinging his
walking-stick nonchalantly, he clipped the blossoms off the
buttercups as he passed them; now he paused to light a
fresh cigar from the butt of the one that he was smoking;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
now he lingered a moment in the shade of an old chestnut
tree. All the time I was gaining on him; but now the
store was hard by.</p>

<p>Should I keep on until I had passed him and, turning
back, could meet him face to face? No, Uncle Seth would
surely stop me. In my determination to get a good look
at the man, I was about to break into a run, when, to my
amazement, he turned to the left toward the very place
where I was going.</p>

<p>So close to him had I now come that, when he stood on
the threshold, I was setting foot on the lower step. I
could see Uncle Seth's clerks, Arnold Lamont, a Frenchman,
and Simeon Muzzy, busily at work in the back
room. I could see, as before, Uncle Seth's bald head
shining above the top of his desk. But my eyes were
all for the stranger, and I now saw plainly that in the
ring on his finger there flashed a great white diamond.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, hearing our steps, raised his head. "Well?"
he said sharply, in the dictatorial way that was so characteristic
of him.</p>

<p>"Well!" repeated the stranger in a voice that startled
me. It was deep and gruff, and into the monosyllable
the man put a solid, heavy emphasis, which made my
uncle's sharpness seem as light as a woman's burst of
temper.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, too, was startled, I think, for he raised his
head and irritably peered over the steel rims of his spectacles.
"Well," he grumpily responded, "what do you
want of me?"</p>

<p>"An hour of your time," said the stranger, lowering his
voice.</p>

<p>"Time's money," returned my uncle.</p>

<p>"I'm the lad to transmute it into fine gold for you,
Seth Upham," said the stranger.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know my name?"</p>

<p>"That's a foolish question to ask. Everyone in town
can tell a stranger the name of the man who keeps the
village store."</p>

<p>My uncle grunted irritably, and brushed his chin with
the feather of his quill.</p>

<p>"Come," said the stranger, "where's a chair?"</p>

<p>"Them that come to this store to loaf," my uncle cried,
"generally sit on cracker-boxes. I'm a busy man."</p>

<p>He was still looking closely at the stranger, but his
voice indicated that, after all, it might not be so hard to
mollify him.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't proud," the stranger said with a conciliatory
gesture, but without the faintest flicker of a
smile. "It won't be the first time I've set on a cracker-box
and talked to Seth Upham. I mind a time once
when old Parker used to keep the store, and me and you
had stole our hats full of crackers, which we ate in the
little old camp over by the river."</p>

<p>"Who," cried Uncle Seth, "who in heaven's name are
you?"</p>

<p>He was pale to the very summit of his bald head; unconscious
of what he was doing, he had thrust his pen
down on the open ledger, where it left a great blotch of
wet ink.</p>

<p>"Hgh! You've got no great memory for old friends,
have you, Seth? You're rich now, I hear. Money-bags
full of gold. Well, 'time's money,' you said. You're
going to put in a golden hour with me this day."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth got up and laid a trembling hand on the
back of his desk. "Neil Gleazen! Cornelius Gleazen!"
he gasped.</p>

<p>The stranger pushed his beaver back on his head, and
with the finger on which the diamond sparkled flicked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
ash from his cigar. "It's me, Seth," he returned; and for
the first time since I had seen him he laughed a deep,
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, what'll you have?" Uncle Seth demanded
hotly. "I'm an honest man. I'm a deacon in the church.
My business is an honest business. There's nothing here
for you, Neil! What do you want?"</p>

<p>In spite of his apparent anger,&mdash;or because of it,&mdash;Uncle
Seth's voice trembled.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you mean by all this talk of an honest
man? Ain't I an honest man?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hgh! You've not got much to say to that, have
you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;why&mdash;I don't&mdash;know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course you don't know. You don't know an honest
man when you see one. Don't talk to me like that,
Seth Upham. You and me has robbed too many churches
together when we was boys to have you talk like that
now. You and me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake keep still!" Uncle Seth cried.
"Customers are coming."</p>

<p>Neil Gleazen grunted again. Pushing a cracker-box
into the corner behind Uncle Seth's desk and placing his
beaver on it, he settled back in Uncle Seth's own chair,
with a cool impudent wink at me, as if for a long stay,
while Uncle Seth, with an eagerness quite unlike his usual
abrupt, scornful manner, rushed away from his unwelcome
guest and proceeded to make himself surprisingly
agreeable to a pair of country woman who wished to barter
butter for cotton cloth.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="small">MY UNCLE BEHAVES QUEERLY</span></h3>

<p>The village of Topham, to which, after an absence of
twenty years, Cornelius Gleazen had returned as a stranger,
lay near the sea and yet not beside it, near the post
road and yet not upon it. From the lower branches of
an old pine that used to stand on the hill behind the tavern
we could see a thread of salt water, which gleamed
like silver in the sun; and, on the clearest days, if we
climbed higher, we could sometimes catch a glimpse of
tiny ships working up or down the coast.</p>

<p>In the other direction, if we faced about, we could see,
far down a long, broad valley, between low hills, a bit of
white road that ran for a mile or two between meadows
and marshes; and on the road we sometimes saw moving
black dots trailing tiny clouds of dust, which we knew
were men and horses and coaches.</p>

<p>In Topham I was born, and there I spent my boyhood.
I suppose that I was quieter than the average boy and
more studious, for I was content to find adventures in
the pages of books, and I read from cover to cover all the
journals of the day that came to hand. Certainly I was a
dreamy lad, who knew books better than men, and who
cared so little for "practical affairs" that much passed
me by unnoticed which many another youth of no more
native keenness would instantly have perceived.</p>

<p>When my mother, some years after my father's death,
came to live with her brother and keep his house for him,
it did not make so great a change in my manner of life as
one might have expected. Bustling, smart Uncle Seth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
ruled the household with a quick, nervous hand; and for
the time, as he bent all his energies to the various projects
in which he was interested and in which he was more than
ordinarily successful, he almost ignored his nephew.</p>

<p>It was not strange that after my mother died Uncle
Seth should give me more thought, for he was left a second
time alone in the world, and except for me he had
neither close friend nor blood relation. I think that his
very shrewdness, which must have shown him how much
a man needs friends, perversely kept him from making
them; it built around him a fence of cold, calculating, selfish
appraisal that repelled most people whom he might
have drawn closer to him. But to me, who had on him
claims of a kind, and whom he had come by slow stages
to know intimately, he gave a queer, testy, impulsive
affection; and although the first well-meant but ill-chosen
act by which he manifested it was to withdraw
me from my books to the store, where he set me to learn
the business, for which I was by no means so grateful as
I should have been, both I and his two clerks, Sim Muzzy
and Arnold Lamont, to whom long association had revealed
the spontaneous generosity of which he seemed
actually to be ashamed, had a very real affection for him.</p>

<p>It was no secret that he intended to make me his heir,
and I was regarded through the town as a young man of
rare prospects, which reconciled me in a measure to exchanging
during the day my worn volumes of Goldsmith
and Defoe for neat columns that represented profit and
loss on candles and sugar and spice; and my hard, faithful
work won Uncle Seth's confidence, and with it a curiously
grudging acknowledgment. Thus our little world of
business moved monotonously, though not unpleasantly,
round and round the cycle of the seasons, until the day
when Cornelius Gleazen came back to his native town.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>He continued to sit in my uncle's chair, that first morning,
while Uncle Seth, perspiring, it seemed to me, more
freely than the heat of the day could have occasioned,
bustled about and waited on his customers. I suppose
that Neil Gleazen really saw nothing out of the ordinary
in Uncle Seth's manner; but to me, who knew him so
well now, it was plain that, instead of trying to get the
troublesome women and their little business of eggs and
cloth done with and out of the store as quickly as possible,
which under the circumstances was what I should
have expected of him, he was trying by every means in
his power to prolong their bartering. And whether or not
Neil Gleazen suspected this, with imperturbable assurance
he watched Uncle Seth pass from one end of the store
to the other.</p>

<p>When at last the women went away and Uncle Seth
returned to his desk, Gleazen removed the beaver from
the cracker-box, and blowing a ring of smoke out across
the top of the desk, watched the draft from the door tear
it into thin blue shreds. "Sit down," he said calmly.</p>

<p>I was already staring at them in amazement; but my
amazement was fourfold when Uncle Seth hesitated,
gulped, and <i>seated himself on the cracker-box</i>.</p>

<p>"Joe," he said in an odd voice, "go help Arnold and
Sim in the back shop."</p>

<p>So I went out and left them; and when I came back,
Cornelius Gleazen was gone. But the next day he came
again, and the next, and the next.</p>

<p>That he was the very man the smith and his cronies
had thought him, I learned beyond peradventure of a
doubt. Strange tales were whispered here and there
about the village, and women covertly turned their eyes
to watch him when he passed. Some men who had known
him in the old days tried to conceal it, and pretended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
be ignorant of all that concerned him, and gave him the
coldest of cold stares when they chanced to meet him
face to face. Others, on the contrary, courted his attention
and called on him at the tavern, and went away, red
with anger, when he coldly snubbed them.</p>

<p>At the time it seemed to make little difference to him
what they thought. Strangely enough, the Cornelius
Gleazen who had come back to his boyhood home was a
very different Cornelius, people found, from the one who,
twenty years before, had gone away by night with the
town officers hot on his trail.</p>

<p>Strange stories of that wild night passed about the
town, and I learned, in one way and another, that Gleazen
was not the only lad who had then disappeared. There
was talk of one Eli Norton, and of foul play, and an ugly
word was whispered. But it had all happened long before,
much had been forgotten, and some things had never
come to light, and the officers who had run Gleazen out
of town were long since dead. So, as the farmer by the
smithy had said would be the case, the old scandals were
let lie, and Gleazen went his way unmolested.</p>

<p>That my uncle would gladly have been rid of the fellow,
for all his grand airs and the pocketfuls of money
that he would throw out on the bar at the inn or on the
counter at the store, I very well knew; I sometimes saw
him wince at Gleazen's effrontery, or start to retort with
his customary sharpness, and then go red or pale and press
his lips to a straight line. Yet I could not imagine why
this should be. If any other man had treated him so,
Uncle Seth would have turned on him with the sharpest
words at his command.</p>

<p>It was not like him to sit meekly down to another's
arrogance. He had been too long a leading man in our
community. But Cornelius Gleazen seemed to have cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a spell upon him. The longer Gleazen would sit and
watch Uncle Seth, the more overbearing would his manner
become and the more nervous would Uncle Seth
grow.</p>

<p>I then believed, and still do, that if my uncle had stood
up to him, as man to man, on that first day, Neil Gleazen
would have pursued a very different course. But Uncle
Seth, if he realized it at all, realized it too late.</p>

<p>At the end of a week Gleazen seemed to have become a
part of the store. He would frown and look away out of
the window, and scarcely deign to reply if any of the poorer
or less reputable villagers spoke to him, whether their
greeting was casual or pretentious; but he would nod affably,
and proffer cigars, and exchange observations on
politics and affairs of the world, when the minister or the
doctor or any other of the solid, substantial men of the
place came in.</p>

<p>I sometimes saw Uncle Seth surreptitiously watching
him with a sort of blank wonder; and once, when we had
come home together late at night, he broke a silence of a
good two hours by remarking as casually as if we had
talked of nothing else all the evening, "I declare to goodness,
Joe, it does seem as if Neil Gleazen had reformed.
I could almost take my oath he's not spoken to one of the
old crowd since he returned. Who would have thought
it? It's strange&mdash;passing strange."</p>

<p>It was the question that the whole town was asking&mdash;who
would have thought it? I had heard enough by now
of the old escapades,&mdash;drunken revels in the tavern, raids
on a score of chicken-roosts and gardens, arrant burglary,
and even, some said, arson,&mdash;to understand why they
asked the question. But more remarkable by far to me
was the change that had come over my uncle. Never
before had the business of the store been better; never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
before had there been more mortgages and notes locked
up in the big safe; never had our affairs of every description
flourished so famously. But whereas, in other seasons
of greater than ordinary prosperity, Uncle Seth had become
almost genial, I had never seen him so dictatorial
and testy as now. Some secret fear seemed to haunt him
from day to day and from week to week.</p>

<p>Thinking back on that morning when Cornelius Gleazen
first came to our store, I remembered a certain sentence
he had spoken. "You and me has robbed too many
churches together when we was boys&mdash;" I wondered if I
could not put my finger on the secret of the change that
had come over my uncle.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="small">HIGGLEBY'S BARN</span></h3>

<p>That Cornelius Gleazen had returned to Topham a
reformed and honest man, the less skeptical people in
the village now freely asserted. To be sure, some said
that no good could come from any man who wore a diamond
on his finger, to say nothing of another in his stock,
and the minister held aloof for reasons known only to
himself. But there was something hearty and wholesome
in Gleazen's gruff voice and blunt, kindly wit that
quite turned aside the shafts of criticism, particularly
when he had made it plain that he would associate only
with people of unquestioned respectability; and his devout
air, as he sat in the very front pew in church and
sang the hymns in a fine, reverberating bass, almost&mdash;although
never quite&mdash;won over even the minister. All
were agreed that you could pardon much in a man who
had lived long in foreign parts; and if any other argument
were needed, Gleazen's own free-handed generosity
for every good cause provided it.</p>

<p>There were even murmurs that a man with Seth
Upham's money might well learn a lesson from the
stranger within our gates, which came to my uncle's
ears, by way of those good people you can find in every
town who feel it incumbent on them to repeat in confidence
that which they have gained in confidence, and
caused him no little uneasiness.</p>

<p>Of the probity of Cornelius Gleazen the village came
gradually to have few doubts; and those of us who believed
in the man were inclined to belittle the blacksmith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
who persisted in thinking ill of him, and even the
minister. Unquestionably Gleazen had seen the error of
his youthful ways and had profited by the view, which,
by all accounts, must have been extensive.</p>

<p>It was a fine thing to see him sitting on the tavern
porch or in my uncle's store and discoursing on the news
of the day. By a gesture, he would dispose of the riots
in England and leave us marveling at his keenness. The
riots held a prominent place in the papers, and we argued
that a man who could so readily place them where they
belonged must have a head of no mean order. Of affairs
in South America, where General Paez had become
Civil and Military Dictator of Venezuela, he had more to
say; for General Paez, it seemed, was a friend of his. I
have wondered since about his boasted friendship with
the distinguished general, but at the time he convinced
us that Venezuela was a fortunate state and that her
affairs were much more important to men of the world
than a bill to provide for the support of aged survivors of
the Army of the Revolution, which a persistent one-legged
old chap from the Four Corners tried a number of
times to introduce into the conversation.</p>

<p>There came a day when both the doctor and the minister
joined the circle around Cornelius Gleazen. Never
was there prouder man! He fairly expanded in the
warmth of their interest. His gestures were more impressive
than ever before; his voice was more assertive.
Yet behind it all I perceived a curious twinkle in his
eyes, and I got a perverse impression that even then
the man was laughing up his sleeve. This did not in
itself set my mind on new thoughts; but to add to my
curiosity, when the doctor and the minister were leaving,
I saw that they were talking in undertones and smiling
significantly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Late one night toward the end of that week, I was returning
from Boston, whither I had gone to buy ten
pipes of Schiedam gin and six of Old East India Madeira,
which a correspondent of my uncle's had lately imported.
An acquaintance from the next town had given me a
lift along the post road as far as a certain short cut, which
led through a pine woods and across an open pasture
where once there had been a farmhouse and where, although
the house had burned to the ground eight or ten
years since, a barn still stood, which was known throughout
the countryside as "Higgleby's."</p>

<p>The sky was overcast, but the moonlight nevertheless
sifted through the thin clouds; and with a word of thanks
to the lad who had brought me thus far, I vaulted the
bars and struck off toward the pines.</p>

<p>My eyes were already accustomed to the darkness, and
the relief from trying to see my way under the thickly
interwoven branches of the grove made the open pasture,
when I came to it, seem nearly as light as day, although,
of course, to anyone coming out into it from a lighted
room, it would have seemed quite otherwise. Of the old
barn, which loomed up on the hill, a black, gaunt, lonesome
object a mile or so away, I thought very little, as I
walked along, until it seemed to me that I saw a glimmer
of fire through a breach where a board had been torn off.</p>

<p>Now the barn was remote from the woods and from
the village; but the weather had been dry, the dead grass
in the old pasture was as inflammable as tinder, and
what wind there was, was blowing toward the pines.
Since it was plain that I ought to investigate that flash
of fire, I left the path and began to climb the hill.</p>

<p>Stopping suddenly, I listened with all my ears. I
thought I had heard voices; it behooved me to be cautious.
Prudently, now, I advanced, and as silently as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
possible. Now I <i>knew</i> that I heard voices. The knowledge
that there were men in the old barn relieved me of
any sense of duty in the matter of a possible fire, but at
the same time it kindled my imagination. Who were
they, and why had they come, and what were they doing?
Instead of walking boldly up to the barn door, I began
to climb the wall that served as the foundation.</p>

<p>The wall was six or eight feet high, but built of large
stones, which afforded me easy hold for foot and hand,
and from the top I was confident that I could peek in at
a window just above. Very cautiously I climbed from
rock to rock, until I was on my knees on the topmost tier.
Now, twisting about and keeping flat to the barn with
both arms extended so as not to overbalance and fall, I
raised myself little by little, only to find, to my keen disappointment,
that the window was still ten inches above
my eyes.</p>

<p>That I should give up then, never occurred to me. I
placed both hands on the sill and silently lifted myself
until my chin was well above it.</p>

<p>In the middle of the old barn, by the light of four
candles, a number of men were playing cards. I could
hear much of what they said, but it concerned only the
fortunes of the game, and as they spoke in undertones I
could not recognize their voices.</p>

<p>For all that I got from their conversation they might
as well have said naught, except that the sound of their
talking and the clink of money as it changed hands served
to cover whatever small noises I may have made, and
thus enabled me to look in upon them undiscovered. Nor
could I see who they were, for the candle light was dim
and flickered, and those who were back to me, as they
pressed forward in their eagerness to follow the play,
concealed the faces of those opposite them. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
my position was extremely uncomfortable, perhaps even
dangerous. So I lowered myself until my toes rested on
the wall of rock, and kneeling very cautiously, began to
descend.</p>

<p>Exploring with my foot until I found a likely stone, I
put my weight on it, and felt it turn. Failing to clutch
the top of the wall, I went down with a heavy thud.</p>

<p>For a moment I lay on the ground with my wind
knocked out of me, completely helpless. Then sharp
voices broke the silence, and the sound of someone opening
the barn door instilled enough wholesome fear into
me to enable me to get up on all fours after a fashion, and
creep cautiously away.</p>

<p>From the darkness outside, my eyes being already accustomed
to the absence of light, I could see a number of
men standing together in front of the barn door. They
must have blown out the candles, for the door and the
windows and the chinks between the boards were dark.
Cursing myself for a silly fool, I made off as silently as
possible.</p>

<p>I had not recognized one of the players, I had got a
bad tumble and sore joints for my trouble, and my pride
was hurt. In short, I felt that I had fallen out of the
small end of the horn, and I was in no cheerful mood as
I limped along. But by the time I came into the village
half an hour later, I had recovered my temper and my
wind; and so, although I earnestly desired to go home
and to bed, to rest my lame bones, I decided to go first
to the store and report to Uncle Seth the results of my
mission.</p>

<p>Through the lighted windows of the store, as I approached,
I could see Arnold Lamont and Sim Muzzy
playing chess in the back room. They were a strange
pair, and as ill matched as any two you ever saw. Lamont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was a Frenchman, who had appeared, seemingly from
nowhere, ten or a dozen years before, and in quaintly
precise English had asked for work&mdash;only because it
was so exceedingly precise, would you have suspected
that it was a foreigner's English. He carried himself
with a strange dignity, and his manner, which seemed to
confer a favor rather than to seek one, had impressed
Uncle Seth almost against his will.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he had said sharply, "there's work enough
to keep another man. But what, pray, has brought you
here?"</p>

<p>"It is the fortune of war," Lamont had replied. And
that was all that my uncle ever got out of him.</p>

<p>Without more ado he had joined Sim Muzzy, a well-meaning,
simple fellow who had already worked for Uncle
Seth for some eight years, and there he had stayed ever
since.</p>

<p>Arnold and Sim shared the room above the store and
served both as watchmen and as clerks; but it was Sim
who cooked their meals, who made their beds, who swept
and dusted and polished. Although the two worked for
equally small pay and, all in all, were as satisfactory men
as any storekeeper could hope to have, Arnold had carried
even into the work of the store that same odd, foreign
dignity; and it apparently never occurred, even to petulant,
talkative Sim, that Arnold, so reserved, so quietly
assured, should have lent his hand to mere domestic
duties.</p>

<p>Learning early in their acquaintance, each that the
other played chess, they had got a board and a set of men,
and, in spite of a disparity in skill that for some people
must have made it very irksome, had kept the game up
ever since. Arnold Lamont played chess with the same
precision with which he spoke English; and if Sim Muzzy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
managed to catch him napping, and so to win one game
in twenty, it was a feat to be talked about for a month to
come.</p>

<p>Through the windows, as I said, I saw them playing
chess in the back shop; then, coming round the corner of
the store, I saw someone just entering. It was no other
than Cornelius Gleazen, in beaver, stock, coat, and diamonds,
with the perpetual cigar bit tight between his
teeth.</p>

<p>A little to my surprise, I noticed that there were beads
of perspiration on his forehead. I had been walking fast
myself, and yet I had not thought of it as a warm evening:
the overcast sky and the wind from the sea, with
their promise of rain to break the drouth, combined to
make the night the coolest we had had for some weeks.
It surprised me also to see that Gleazen was breathing
hard&mdash;but was he? I could not be sure.</p>

<p>Then, through the open door, I again saw Arnold
Lamont in the back room. In his hand he was holding
a knight just over the square on which it was to rest; but
with his eyes he was following Cornelius Gleazen across
the store and round behind my uncle's desk, where now
there was a second chair in place of the cracker-box.</p>

<p>When Gleazen had sat down beside my uncle, he tapping
the desk with a long pencil, which he had drawn
from his pocket, Uncle Seth bustling about among his
papers, with quick useless sallies here and there, and into
the pigeonholes, as if he were confused by the mass of
business that confronted him,&mdash;it was a manner he sometimes
affected when visitors were present,&mdash;Arnold
Lamont put down the knight and absently, as if his mind
were far away, said in his calm, precise voice, "Check!"</p>

<p>"No, no! You mustn't do that! You can't do that!
That's wrong! See! You were on that square there&mdash;see?&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
you moved so! You can't put your knight
there," Sim Muzzy cried.</p>

<p>That Lamont had transgressed by mistake the rules of
the game hit Sim like a thunderclap and even further befuddled
his poor wits.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lamont, "I see. I beg you, pardon my
error. So! Check."</p>

<p>He again moved the knight, apparently without
thought; and Sim Muzzy fell to biting his lip and puzzling
this way and that and working his fingers, which
he always did when he was getting the worst of the
game.</p>

<p>Arnold Lamont seemed not to care a straw about the
game. Through the door he was watching Cornelius
Gleazen. And Cornelius Gleazen was wiping his forehead
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>I wondered if it was my lively imagination that made
me think that he was breathing quickly. How long
would it have taken him, I wondered, to cut across the
pasture from Higgleby's barn to the north road? Coming
thus by the Four Corners, could he have reached the
store ahead of me? Or could he, by way of the shun-pike,
have passed me on the road?</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="small">SWORDS AND SHIPS</span></h3>

<p>Having succeeded in establishing himself in the society
and confidence of the more substantial men of the village,
and having discomfited completely those few&mdash;among
whom remained the blacksmith&mdash;who had treated him
shabbily in the first weeks of his return and had continued
ever since to regard him with suspicion, Cornelius
Gleazen began now to extend his campaign to other quarters,
and to curry favor among those whose good-will, so
far as I could see, was really of little weight one way or
another. He now cast off something of his arrogant, disdainful
air, and won the hearts of the children by strange
knickknacks and scrimshaws, which he would produce,
sometimes from his pockets, and sometimes, by delectable
sleight of hand, from the very air itself. Before
long half the homes in the village boasted whale's teeth
on which were wrought pictures of whales and ships and
savages, or chips of ivory carved into odd little idols, and
every one of them, you would find, if you took the trouble
to ask, came from the old chests that Neil Gleazen kept
under the bed in his room at the tavern, where now he
was regarded as the prince of guests.</p>

<p>To those who were a little older he gave more elaborate
trinkets of ivory and of dark, strange woods; and the report
grew, and found ready belief, that he had prospered
greatly in trade before he decided to retire, and that he
had brought home a fortune with which to settle down
in the old town; for the toys that he gave away so freely
were worth, we judged, no inconsiderable sum. But to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the lads in their early twenties, of whom I was one, he
endeared himself perhaps most of all when, one fine afternoon,
smoking one of his long cigars and wearing his
beaver tilted forward at just such an angle, he came down
the road with a great awkward bundle under his arm, and
disclosed on the porch of my uncle's store half a dozen
foils and a pair of masks.</p>

<p>He smiled when all the young fellows in sight and
hearing gathered round him eagerly, and called one another
to come and see, and picked up the foils and passed
at one another awkwardly. There was an odd satisfaction
in his smile, as if he had gained something worth the
having. What a man of his apparent means could care
for our good-will, I could not have said if anyone had asked
me, and at the time I did not think to wonder about it.
But his air of triumph, when I later had occasion to recall
it to mind, convinced me that for our good-will he did
care, and that he was man&oelig;uvring to win and hold it.</p>

<p>It was interesting to mark how the different ones took
his playthings. Sim Muzzy cried out in wonder and
earnestly asked, "Are those what men kill themselves
with in duels? Pray how do they stick 'em in when the
points are blunted?" Arnold Lamont, without a word
or a change of expression, picked up a foil at random and
tested the blade by bending it against the wall. Uncle
Seth, having satisfied his curiosity by a glance, cried
sharply, "That's all very interesting, but there's work
to be done. Come, come, I pay no one for gawking out
the door."</p>

<p>The lively hum of voices continued, and a number of
town boys remained to examine the weapons; but Arnold,
Sim, and I obediently turned back into the store.</p>

<p>"That's all right, lads," Cornelius Gleazen cried.
"Come evening, I'll show you a few points on using these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
toys. I'll make a fencing-master and a good one, I'll
have you know, and there are some among you that have
the making of swordsmen. You're one, Joe Woods,
you're one."</p>

<p>I was pleased to be singled out, and went to my work
with a will, thinking meanwhile of the promised lessons.
It never occurred to me that Cornelius Gleazen could
have had a motive that did not appear on the surface for
so choosing my name from all the rest.</p>

<p>That evening, true to his promise, he took us in hand
on the village green, with four fifths of the village standing
by to watch, and gave us lessons in thrusting and
parrying and stepping swiftly forward and backward.
We were an awkward company of recruits, and for our
pains we got only hearty laughter from the onlookers;
but the new sport captured our imagination, and realizing
that, once upon a time, even Cornelius Gleazen himself
had been a tyro, we zealously worked to learn what
we could, and in our idle moments we watched with frank
admiration the grand flourishes and great leaps and
stamps of which Gleazen was master.</p>

<p>The diamond on the finger of his gracefully curved left
hand flashed as he sprang about, and his ruffled shirt,
damped by his unwonted exercise, clung close to his big
shoulders and well-formed back. Surely, we thought,
few could equal his surprising agility; the great voice in
which he roared his suggestions and commands increased
our confidence in his knowledge of swordsmanship.</p>

<p>When, after my second turn at his instruction, I came
away with my arms aching from the unaccustomed exertion
and saw that Arnold Lamont was watching us and
covertly smiling, I flamed red and all but lost my temper.
Why should he laugh at <i>me</i>, I thought. Surely I was no
clumsier than the others. Indeed, he who thought himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
so smart probably could not do half so well. Had
not Mr. Gleazen praised me most of all? In my anger
at Arnold's secret amusement, I avoided him that evening
and for several days to come.</p>

<p>It was on Saturday night, when we were closing the
store for the week, that quite another subject led me back
to my resentment in such a way that we had the matter
out between us; and as all that we had to say is more or
less intimately connected with my story I will set it down
word for word.</p>

<p>A young woman in a great quilted bonnet of the kind
that we used to call calash, and a dress that she no doubt
thought very fetching, came mincing into the store and
ordered this thing and that in a way that kept me attending
closely to her desires. When she had gone mincing
out again, I turned so impatiently to put the counter
to rights, that Arnold softly chuckled.</p>

<p>"Apparently," said he, with a quiet smile, "the lady
did not impress you quite as she desired, Joe."</p>

<p>"Impress me!" I snorted, ungallantly imitating her
mincing manner. "She impressed me as much as any
of them."</p>

<p>"You must have patience, Joe. Some day there will
come a lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" I cried, with the cocksure assertiveness of
my years.</p>

<p>"But yes!"</p>

<p>"Not I! No, no, Arnold&mdash;, 'needles and pins, needles
and pins'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When a man marries his trouble begins?" Sadness
now shadowed Arnold's expressive face. "No!
Proverbs sometimes are pernicious."</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me!"</p>

<p>I had detected, through the veil of melancholy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
seemed to have fallen over him, a faint ray of something
akin to humor.</p>

<p>"I am not laughing at you, Joe." His voice was sad.
"You will marry some day&mdash;marry and settle down.
It is good to do so. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was something in his stopping that made me
look at him in wonder. Immediately he was himself
again, calm, wise, taciturn; but in spite of my youth I
instinctively felt that only by suffering could a man win
his way to such kindly, quiet dignity.</p>

<p>I had said that I would not marry: no wonder, I have
since thought, that Arnold looked at me with that gentle
humor. Never dreaming that in only a few short months
a new name and a new face were to fill my mind and my
heart with a world of new anxieties and sorrows and joys,
never dreaming of the strange and distant adventures
through which Arnold and I were to pass,&mdash;if a fortune-teller
had foretold the story, I should have laughed it to
scorn,&mdash;I was only angry at his amused smile. Perhaps
I had expected him to argue with me, to try to correct
my notions. In any case, when he so kindly and yet
keenly appraised at its true worth my boyish pose, I was
sobered for a moment by the sadness that he himself had
revealed; then I all but flew into a temper.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well! Go on and laugh at me. You were
laughing at me the other night when I was fencing, too.
I saw you. I'd like to see you do better yourself. Go
on and laugh, you who are so wise."</p>

<p>Arnold's smile vanished. "I am not laughing at you,
Joe. Nor was I laughing at you then."</p>

<p>"You were not laughing at me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"At whom, then, were you laughing?"</p>

<p>To this Arnold did not reply.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The fencing lessons, begun so auspiciously that first
evening, became a regular event. Every night we gathered
on the green and fenced together until twilight had
all but settled into dark. Little by little we learned such
tricks of attack and defense as our master could teach
us, until we, too, could stamp and leap, and parry with
whistling circles of the blade. And as we did so, we
young fellows of the village came more and more to look
upon Cornelius Gleazen almost as one of us.</p>

<p>Though his coming had aroused suspicion, though for
many weeks there were few who would say a good word
for him, as the summer wore away, he established himself
so firmly in the life of his native town that people
began to forget, as far as anyone could see, that he had
ever had occasion to leave it in great haste.</p>

<p>If he praised my fencing and gave me more time than
the others, I thought it no more than my due&mdash;was I
not a young man of great prospects? If Uncle Seth had
at first regarded him with suspicion, Uncle Seth, too, had
quite returned now to his old abrupt, masterful way and
was again as sharp and quick of tongue as ever, even when
Neil Gleazen was sitting in Uncle Seth's own chair and at
his own desk. Perhaps, had we been keener, we should
have suspected that something was wrong, simply because
<i>no one</i>&mdash;except a few stupid persons like the blacksmith&mdash;had
a word to say against Neil Gleazen. You would at
least have expected his old cronies to resent his leaving
them for more respectable company. But not even from
them did there come a whisper of suspicion or complaint.</p>

<p>Why should not a man come home to his native place
to enjoy the prosperity of his later years? we argued. It
was the most natural thing in the world; and when Cornelius
Gleazen talked of foreign wars and the state of the
country and the deaths of Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and of the duel between Mr. Clay and Mr. Randolph, the
most intelligent of us listened with respect, and found occasion
in his shrewd observations and trenchant comment
to rejoice that Topham had so able a son to return to her
in the full power of his maturity.</p>

<p>There was even talk of sending him to Congress, and
that it was not idle gossip I know because three politicians
from Boston came to town and conferred with our selectmen
and Judge Bordman over their wine at the inn for a
long evening; and Peter Nuttles, whose sister waited on
them, spread the story to the ends of the county.</p>

<p>Late one night, when Uncle Seth and I were about to
set out for home, leaving Arnold and Sim to lock up the
store, we parted with Gleazen on the porch, he stalking
off to the right in the moonlight and swinging his cane as
he went, we turning our backs on the village and the
bright windows of the tavern, and stepping smartly toward
our own dark house, in which the one lighted lamp shone
from the window of the room that Mrs. Jameson, our
housekeeper, occupied.</p>

<p>"He's a man of judgment," Uncle Seth said, as if meditating
aloud, "rare judgment and a wonderful knowledge
of the world."</p>

<p>He seemed to expect no reply, and I made none.</p>

<p>"He was venturesome to rashness as a boy," Uncle
Seth presently continued. "All that seems to have
changed now."</p>

<p>We walked along through the dust. The weeds beside
the road and the branches of the trees and shrubs were
damp with dew.</p>

<p>"As a boy," Uncle Seth said at last, "I should never
have thought of going to Neil Gleazen for judgment&mdash;aye,
or for knowledge." And when we stood on the porch
in the moonlight and looked back at the village, where all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the houses were dark now except for a lamp here and there
that continued to burn far into the night, he added,
"How would you like to leave all this, Joe, and wrestle a
fall with fortune for big stakes&mdash;aye, for rich stakes,
with everything in our favor to win?"</p>

<p>At something in his voice I turned on my heel, my
heart leaping, and stared hard at him.</p>

<p>As if he suddenly realized that he had been saying things
he ought not to say, he gave himself a quick shake, and
woke from his meditations with a start. "We must away
to bed," he cried sharply. "It's close on midnight."</p>

<p>Here was a matter for speculation. For an hour that
afternoon and for another hour that evening Uncle Seth
and Neil Gleazen had sat behind my uncle's desk, with
their chairs drawn close together and the beaver laid on
the cracker-box, and had scribbled endless columns of figures
and mysterious notes on sheet after sheet of foolscap.
What, I wondered, did it mean?</p>

<p>At noon next day, as I was waiting on customers in the
front of the store, I saw a rider with full saddlebags pass,
on a great black horse, and shortly afterwards I heard one
of the customers remark that the horse was standing at the
inn. Glancing out of the window, I saw that the rider had
dismounted and was talking with Cornelius Gleazen;
though the distance was considerable, Gleazen's bearing
and the forward tilt of his beaver were unmistakable.
When next I passed the window, I saw that Gleazen was
posting down the road toward the store, with his beaver
tipped even farther over his right eye, his cane swinging,
and a bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>As I bowed the customers out, Gleazen entered the
store, brushing past me with a nod, and loudly called,
"Seth Upham! Seth Upham! Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here I am. What's wanted?" my uncle testily retorted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
as he emerged from a bin into which he had thrust
his head and shoulders in his efforts to fill a peck measure.</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried Gleazen in his great, gruff voice.
"Here's news!"</p>

<p>"News," returned my uncle, sharply; "news is no reason
to scare a man out of a year's growth."</p>

<p>Neil Gleazen laughed loudly and gave my uncle a resounding
slap on the back that made him writhe. "News,
Seth, news is the key to fortune. Come, man, come, lay
by your pettifogging. Here's papers just in by the post.
You ain't going to let 'em lie no more than I am."</p>

<p>To my amazement,&mdash;I could never get used to it,&mdash;my
uncle's resentment seemed to go like mist before the
sun, and he said not a word against the boisterous roughness
of the friend of his youth, although I almost believe
that, if anyone else had dared to treat him so, he would
have grained the man with a hayfork. Instead, he wiped
his hands on his coarse apron and followed Gleazen to
the desk, where they sat down in the two chairs that now
were always behind it.</p>

<p>For a time they talked in voices so low that I heard
nothing of their conversation; but after a while, as they
became more and more absorbed in their business, their
voices rose, and I perceived that Gleazen was reading
aloud from the papers some advertisements in which he
seemed especially interested.</p>

<p>"Here's this," he would cry. "Listen to this. If this
ain't a good one, I'll miss my guess. 'Executor's sale,
Ship Congress: on Saturday the 15th, at twelve o'clock,
at the wharf of the late William Gray, Lynn Street, will
be sold at public auction the ship Congress, built at
Mattapoisett near New Bedford in the year 1823 and designed
for the whale fishery. Measures 349 tons, is copper
fastened and was copper sheathed over felt in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
on the first voyage, and is in every respect a first-rate vessel.
She has two suits of sails, chain and hemp cables,
and is well found in the usual appurtenances. By order
of the executors of the late William Gray, Whitewell,
Bond and Company, Auctioneers.' There, Seth, there's
a vessel for you, I'll warrant you."</p>

<p>My uncle murmured something that I could not hear;
then Gleazen tipped his beaver back on his head&mdash;for
once he had neglected to set it on the cracker-box&mdash;and
hoarsely laughed. "Well, I'll be shot!" he roared.
"How's a man to better himself, if he's so confounded
cautious? Well, then, how's this: 'Marshal's Sale. United
States of America, District of Massachusetts, Boston,
August 31, 1826. Pursuant to a warrant from the Honorable
John Davis, Judge of the District Court for the
District aforesaid, I hereby give public notice that I shall
sell at public auction on Wednesday the 8th day of September,
at 12 o'clock noon, at Long Wharf, the schooner
Caroline and Clara, libelled for wages by William Shipley,
and the money arising from the sale to be paid into court.
Samuel D. Hains, Marshal.' That'll come cheap, if
cheap you'll have. But mark what I tell you, Seth, that
what comes cheap, goes cheap. There's no good in it.
It ain't as if you hadn't the money. The plan's mine,
and I tell you, it's a good one, with three merry men
waiting for us over yonder. Half's for you, a whole half,
mind you; and half's to be divided amongst the rest of
us. It don't pay to try to do things cheap. What with
gear carried away and goods damaged, it don't pay."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth was marking lines on the margin of the newspaper
before them.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he began, "how much&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then they talked in undertones, and I heard nothing
more.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="small">A MYSTERIOUS PROJECT</span></h3>

<p>For three days I watched with growing amazement the
strange behavior of my uncle. Now he would sit hunched
up over his desk and search through a great pile of documents
from the safe; now he would toss the papers into his
strong box, lock it, and return it to its place in the vault,
and pace the floor in a revery so deep that you could speak
in his very ear without getting a reply. At one minute he
would be as cross as a devil's imp, and turn on you in fury
if you wished to do him a favor; at the next he would
fairly laugh aloud with good humor.</p>

<p>The only man at whom he never flew out in a rage was
Cornelius Gleazen, and why this should be so, I could only
guess. You may be sure that I, and others, tried hard to
fathom the secret, when the two of them were sitting at my
uncle's desk over a huge mass of papers, as they were for
hours at a time.</p>

<p>On the noon of the third day they settled themselves
together at the desk and talked interminably in undertones.
Now Uncle Seth would bend over his papers; now
he would look off across the road and the meadows to the
woods beyond. Now he would put questions; now he
would sit silent. An hour passed, and another, and another.
At four o'clock they were still there, still talking in undertones.
At five o'clock their heads were closer together than
ever. Now Neil Gleazen was tapping on the top of his
beaver. He had a strange look, which I did not understand,
and between his eyes and the flashing of his diamond
as his finger tapped the hat, he charmed me as if he were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
snake. Even Sim Muzzy was watching them curiously,
and on Arnold Lamont's fine, sober face there was an expression
of mingled wonder and distrust.</p>

<p>Customers came, and we waited on them; and when
they had gone, the two were still there. The clocks were
striking six when I faced about, hearing their chairs move,
and saw them shaking hands and smiling. Then Cornelius
Gleazen went away, and my uncle, carefully locking up his
papers, went out, too.</p>

<p>Supper was late that night, for I waited until Uncle Seth
came in; but he made no excuse for his long absence and
late return. He ate rapidly and in silence, as if he were not
thinking of his food, and he took no wine until he had
pushed his plate away. Then he poured himself a glass
from the decanter, tasted it, and said, "I am to be away
to-morrow, Joe."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I.</p>

<p>"I may be back to-morrow night and I may not. As
to that, I can't say. But I wish, come afternoon, you'd
go to Abe Guptil's for me. I've an errand there I want you
to do."</p>

<p>I waited in silence.</p>

<p>"I hold a mortgage of two thousand dollars on his
place," he presently went on. "I've let it run, out of good-nature.
Good-nature don't pay. Well, I'm going to need
the money. Give him a month to pay up. If he can't, tell
him I'll sell him out."</p>

<p>"You'll what?" I cried, not believing that I heard him
aright.</p>

<p>"I'll sell him out. Pringle has been wanting the place
and he'll give at least two thousand."</p>

<p>"Now, Uncle Seth, Abraham Guptil's been a long time
sick. His best horse broke a leg a while back and he had to
shoot it, and while he was sick his crops failed. He can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
pay you now. Give him another year. He's good for the
money and he pays his interest on the day it's due."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth frowned. "I've been too good-natured," he
said sharply. "I need the money myself. I shall sell him
out."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>I stopped short. After all, I could not save Abe Guptil&mdash;I
knew Uncle Seth too well for that. And it might be
easier for Abe if I broke the news than if, say, Uncle Seth
did.</p>

<p>"Very well," I replied after a moment's thought. "I
will go."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, appeased by my compliance, gave a short
grunt, curtly bade me good-night and stumped off to bed.
But I, wondering what was afoot, sat a long time at table
while the candles burned lower and lower.</p>

<p>Next morning, clad in his Sunday best, Uncle Seth
waited in front of the store, with his horses harnessed and
ready, until the tall familiar figure, with cane, cigar, and
beaver hat, came marching grandly down from the inn.
Then the two got into the carriage and drove away.</p>

<p>Some hours later, leaving Arnold Lamont in charge of
the store, I set off in turn, but humbly and on foot, toward
the white house by the distant sea where poor Abraham
Guptil lived; and you can be sure that it made me sick at
heart to think of my errand.</p>

<p>From the pine land and meadows of Topham, the road
emerged on the border of a salt marsh, along which I
tramped for an hour or two; then, passing now through
scrubby timber, now between barren farms, it led up on
higher ground, which a few miles farther on fell away to
tawny rocks and yellow sand and the sea, which came rolling
in on the beach in long, white hissing waves. Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
in the offing seemed to give promise of other, far-distant
lands; and the sun was so bright and the water so blue
that I thought to myself how much I would give to go
a-sailing with Uncle Seth in search of adventure.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I saw ahead of me, beside the
road, the small white house, miles away from any other,
where Abraham Guptil lived. A dog came barking out at
me, and a little boy came to call back the dog; then a
woman appeared in the door and told me I was welcome.
Abe, it seemed, was away working for a neighbor, but he
would be back soon, for supper-time was near. If I would
stay with them for the meal, she said, they should be glad
and honored.</p>

<p>So I sat down on the doorstone and made friends with
the boy and the dog, and talked away about little things
that interested the boy, until we saw Abraham Guptil
coming home across the fields with the sun at his back.</p>

<p>He shook hands warmly, but his face was anxious, and
when after supper we went out doors and I told him as
kindly as I could the errand on which my uncle had sent
me, he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I feared it," said he. "It's rumored round the country
that Seth Upham's collecting money wherever he
can. Without this, I've been in desperate straits, and
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He spread his hands hopelessly and leaned against the
fence. His eyes wandered over the acres on which he was
raising crops by sheer strength and determination. It was
a poor, stony farm, yet the man had claimed it from the
wilderness and, what with fishing and odd jobs, had been
making a success of life until one misfortune after another
had fairly overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"It must go," he said at last.</p>

<p>As best I could, I was taking leave of him for the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
tramp home, when he suddenly roused himself and cried,
"But stay! See! The storm is hard upon us. You
must not go back until to-morrow."</p>

<p>Heavy clouds were banking in the west, and already we
could hear the rumble of thunder.</p>

<p>It troubled me to accept the hospitality of the Guptils
when I had come on such an errand; but the kindly souls
would hear of no denial, so I joined Abe in the chores with
such good-will, that we had milked, and fed the stock, and
closed the barns for the night before the first drops fell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile much had gone forward indoors, and when
we returned to the house I was shown to a great bed made
up with clean linen fragrant of lavender. Darkness had
scarcely fallen, but I was so weary that I undressed and
threw myself on the bed and went quietly to sleep while
the storm came raging down the coast.</p>

<p>As one so often does in a strange place, I woke uncommonly
early. Dawn had no more than touched the eastern
horizon, but I got out of bed and, hearing someone
stirring, went to the window. A door closed very gently,
then a man came round the corner of the house and struck
off across the fields. It was Abraham Guptil. What could
he be doing abroad at that hour? Going to the door of
my room, which led into the kitchen, I softly opened it,
then stopped in amazement. Someone was asleep on the
kitchen floor. I looked closer and saw that it was a woman
with a child; then I turned back and closed the door again.</p>

<p>Rather than send me away, even though I brought a
message that meant the loss of their home, those good
people had given me the one bed in the house, and themselves,
man, woman, and child, had slept on hard boards,
with only a blanket under them.</p>

<p>Since I could not leave my room without their knowing
that I had discovered their secret, I sat down by the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and watched the dawn come across the sea upon a
world that was clean and cool after the shower of the night.
For an hour, as the light grew stronger, I watched the slow
waves that came rolling in and poured upon the long rocks
in cascades of silver; and still the time wore on, and still
Abe remained away. Another hour had nearly gone when
I saw him coming in the distance along the shore, and
heard his wife stirring outside.</p>

<p>Now someone knocked at my door.</p>

<p>I replied with a prompt "Good-morning," and presently
went into the kitchen, where the three greeted me warmly.
All signs of their sleeping on the kitchen floor had vanished.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I shall do, Joe," said Abraham
Guptil when I was taking leave of him an hour later.
"This place is all I have."</p>

<p>I made up my mind there and then that neither Abraham
Guptil nor his wife and child should suffer want.</p>

<p>"I'll see to that," I replied. "There'll be something
for you to do and some place for you to go."</p>

<p>Then, with no idea how I should fulfil my promise, I
shook his hand and left him.</p>

<p>When at last I got back to the store, Arnold Lamont
was there alone. My uncle had not returned, and Sim
Muzzy had gone fishing. It was an uncommonly hot day,
and since there were few customers, we sat and talked of
one thing and another.</p>

<p>When I saw that Arnold was looking closely at the foils,
which stood in a corner, an idea came to me. Cornelius
Gleazen had praised my swordsmanship to the skies, and,
indeed, I was truly becoming a match for him. Twice I
had actually taken a bout from him, with a great swishing
and clattering of blades and stamping of feet, and now,
although he continued to give me lessons, he no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
would meet me in an assault. As for the other young fellows,
I had far and away outstripped them.</p>

<p>"Would you like to try the foils once, Arnold?" I
asked. "I'll give you a lesson if you say so."</p>

<p>For a moment I thought there was a twinkle in the
depths of his eyes; but when I looked again they were
sober and innocent.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he said.</p>

<p>Something in the way he tested the foils made me a bit
uneasy, in spite of my confidence, but I shrugged it off.</p>

<p>"You have learned well by watching," I said, as we
came on guard.</p>

<p>"I have tried it before," said he.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "I will lunge and you shall see if you
can parry me."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>After a few perfunctory passes, during which I advanced
and retreated in a way that I flattered myself was exceptionally
clever, and after a quick feint in low line, I disengaged,
deceived a counter-parry by doubling, and confidently
lunged. To my amazement my foil rested against
his blade hardly out of line with his body&mdash;so slightly out
of line that I honestly believed the attack had miscarried
by my own clumsiness. Certainly I never had seen so nice
a parry. That I escaped a riposte, I attributed to my deft
recovery and the constant pressure of my blade on his;
but even then I had an uncomfortable suspicion that behind
the veil of his black mask Arnold was smiling, and I
was really dazed by the failure of an attack that seemed
to me so well planned and executed.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, easily, lightly, Arnold Lamont's blade
wove its way through my guard. His arms, his legs, his
body moved with a lithe precision such as I had never
dreamed of; my own foil, circling desperately, failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
find his, and his button rested for a moment against my
right breast so surely and so competently that, in the face
of his skill, I simply dropped my guard and stood in frank
wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>Even then I was vaguely aware that I could not fully
appreciate it. Though I had thought myself an accomplished
swordsman, the man's dexterity, which had revealed
me as a clumsy blunderer, was so amazingly superior
to anything I had ever seen, that I simply could not
realize to the full how remarkable it was.</p>

<p>I whipped off my mask and cried, "You,&mdash;you <i>are</i> a
fencer."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Are you surprised? A man does not tell
all he knows."</p>

<p>As I looked him in the face, I wondered at him. Uncle
Seth had come to rely upon him implicitly for far more
than you can get from any ordinary clerk. Yet we really
knew nothing at all about him. "A man does not tell all
he knows"&mdash;He had held his tongue without a slip for all
those years.</p>

<p>I saw him now in a new light. His face was keen, but
more than keen. There was real wisdom in it. The quiet,
confident dignity with which he always bore himself
seemed suddenly to assume a new, deeper, more mysterious
significance. Whatever the man might be, it was certain
that he was no mere shopkeeper's clerk.</p>

<p>That afternoon Uncle Seth and Gleazen, the one
strangely elated, the other more pompous and grand than
ever, returned in the carriage. Of their errand, for the
time being they said nothing.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth merely asked about Abe Guptil's note; and,
when I answered him, impatiently grunted.</p>

<p>Poor Abe, I thought, and wondered what had come
over my uncle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening, as we were finishing supper, Uncle
Seth leaned back with a broad smile. "Joe, my lad," he
said, "our fortunes are making. Great days are ahead.
I can buy and sell the town of Topham now, but before
we are through, Joe, I&mdash;or you with the money I shall
leave you&mdash;can buy and sell the city of Boston&mdash;aye, or
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. There are great
days ahead, Joe."</p>

<p>"But what," I asked, with fear at my heart, "but what
is this great venture?"</p>

<p>Uncle Seth looked at me with a smile that expressed
whatever power of affection was left in his hard old shell
of a heart,&mdash;a meagre affection, yet, as far as it went, all
centred upon me,&mdash;and revealed a great conceit of his
own wisdom.</p>

<p>"Joe," he said, leaning forward on his elbows till his
face, on which the light threw every testy wrinkle into
sharp relief, was midway between the two candles at the
end of the table, "Joe, I've bought a ship and we're all
going to Africa."</p>

<p>For a moment his voice expressed confidence; for a moment
his affection for me triumphed over his native sharpness.</p>

<p>"You're all I've got, Joey," he cried, "You're all that's
left to the old man, and I'm going to do well by you.
Whatever I have is yours, Joey; it's all coming to you,
every cent and every dollar. Here,&mdash;you must be wanting
a bit of money to spend,&mdash;here!" He thrust his hand
into his pocket and flung half a dozen gold pieces down on
the dark, well-oiled mahogany where they rang and rolled
and shone dully in the candle-light. "I swear, Joey, I
think a lot of you."</p>

<p>I suppose that not five people in all Topham had ever
seen Uncle Seth in such a mood. I am sure that, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
had, the town could never have thought of him as only a
cold, exacting man. But now a fear apparently overwhelmed
him lest by so speaking out through his reticence
he had committed some unforgivable offense&mdash;lest he
had told too much. He seemed suddenly to snap back
into his hard, cynical shell. "But of that, no more," he
said sharply. "Not a word's to be said, you understand.
Not a word&mdash;to <i>any one</i>."</p>

<p>When I went back to the store that evening, I sat on the
porch in the darkness and thought of Uncle Seth as I had
seen him across the table, his face thrust forward between
the candles, his elbows planted on the white linen, with the
dim, restful walls of the room behind him, with the faces
of my father and my mother looking down upon us from
the gilt frames on the wall. I knew him too well to ask
questions, even though, as I sat on the store porch, he was
sitting just behind me inside the open window.</p>

<p>What, I wondered, almost in despair, could we, of all
people, do with a ship and a voyage to Africa? Had I
not seen Cornelius Gleazen play upon my uncle's fear and
vanity and credulity? I had no doubt whatever that the
same Neil Gleazen, who had been run out of town thirty
years before, was at the bottom of whatever mad voyage
my uncle was going to send his ship upon.</p>

<p>Then I thought of good old Abraham Guptil, so soon to
be turned out of house and home, and of Arnold Lamont,
who saw and knew and understood so much, yet said so
little. And again I thought of Cornelius Gleazen; and
when I was thinking of him, a strange thing came to
pass.</p>

<p>Down in the village a dog barked fiercely, then another
nearer the store, then another; then I saw coming up the
road a figure that I could not mistake. The man with that
tall hat, that flowing coat, that nonchalant air, which even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the faint light of the stars revealed, could be no other than
Cornelius Gleazen himself.</p>

<p>In the store behind me I heard the low drone of conversation
from the men gathered round the stove, the
click of a chessman set firmly on the board, the voice of
Arnold Lamont&mdash;so clear, so precise, and yet so definitely
and indescribably foreign&mdash;saying, "Check!"
Through the small panes of glass I saw my uncle frowning
over his ledgers. Now he noted some figure on the foolscap
at his right, now he appeared to count on his fingers.</p>

<p>I turned again to watch Cornelius Gleazen. Of course
he could not know that anyone was sitting on the porch
in the darkness. When he passed the store, he looked over
at it with a turn of his head and a twist of his shoulders.
His gesture gave me an impression of scorn and triumph
so strong that I hardly restrained myself from retorting
loudly and angrily. Then I bit my lip and watched him
go by and disappear.</p>

<p>"Who," I wondered, "who and <i>what</i> really is Cornelius
Gleazen?"</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="small">GOOD-BYE TO OLD HAUNTS AND FACES</span></h3>

<p>That some extraordinary thing was afoot next day,
every soul who worked in our store, or who entered it on
business, vaguely felt. To me, who had gained a hint of
what was going forward,&mdash;baffling and tantalizing, yet a
hint for all that,&mdash;and to Arnold Lamont, who, I was
convinced as I saw him watch my uncle's nervous movements,
although he had no such plain hint to go upon, had
by his keen, silent observation unearthed even more than
I, the sense of an impending great event was far from
vague. I felt as sure as of my own name that before nightfall
something would happen to uproot me from my native
town, whose white houses and green trees and hedges,
kindly people and familiar associations, lovely scenes and
quiet, homely life I so deeply loved.</p>

<p>The strange light in Cornelius Gleazen's eyes, as he
watched us hard at work taking an inventory of stock,
confirmed me in the presentiment. My uncle's harassed,
nervous manner as he drove us on with our various duties,
Sim Muzzy's garrulous bewilderment, and Arnold Lamont's
keen, silent appraisal, added each its little to the
sum of my convictions.</p>

<p>The warmer the day grew, the harder we worked. Uncle
Seth flew about like a madman, picking us up on this thing
and that, and urging one to greater haste, another to
greater care. Throwing off his coat, he pitched in with his
own hands, and performed such prodigies of labor that it
seemed as if our force were doubled by the addition of
himself alone. And all the time Neil Gleazen sat and
smiled and tapped his beaver.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>He was so cool, so impudent about it, that I longed to
turn on him and vent my spleen; but to Uncle Seth it apparently
seemed entirely suitable that Gleazen should idle
while others worked.</p>

<p>Of the true meaning of all this haste and turmoil I had
no further inkling until in the early afternoon Gleazen
called loudly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's here, prompt to the minute."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Seth drew a long breath, mopped the sweat
from his face and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm ready for him, thank heaven! The boys can be
finishing up what little's left."</p>

<p>I looked, and saw a gentleman, just alighted from his
chaise, tying a handsome black horse to the hitching-post
before the door.</p>

<p>Turning his back upon us all, Uncle Seth rushed to the
door, his hands extended, and cried, "Welcome, sir!
Since cock-crow this morning we have been hard at work
upon the inventory, and it's this minute done&mdash;at least,
all but adding a few columns. Sim, another chair by my
desk. Quick! Mr. Gleazen, I wish to present you to Mr.
Brown. Come in, sir, come in."</p>

<p>The three shook hands, and all sat down together and
talked for some time; then, at the stranger's remark,&mdash;"Now
for figures. There's nothing like figures to tell a
story, Mr. Upham. Eh, Mr. Gleazen? We can run over
those columns you spoke of, here and now,"&mdash;they bestirred
themselves.</p>

<p>"You're right, sir," Uncle Seth cried: and then he
sharply called, "Arnold, bring me those lists you've just
finished. That's right; is that all? Well, then you take
the other boys and return those boxes in the back room to
their shelves. That'll occupy you all of an hour."</p>

<p>No longer able to pick up an occasional sentence of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
talk, we glumly retired out of earshot and were more than
ever irritated when Gleazen, his cigar between his teeth,
stamped up to the door between the front room and the
back and firmly closed it.</p>

<p>"Why should they wish so much to be alone?" Arnold
asked.</p>

<p>I ventured no reply; but Sim Muzzy, as if personally
affronted, burst hotly forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'd think Seth Upham would know enough to ask
the advice of a man who's been working for him ever since
Neil Gleazen ran away from home, now wouldn't you?
Here I've toiled day in and out and done good work for
him and learned the business, for all the many times he's
said he never saw a thicker head, until there ain't a better
hand at candling eggs, not this side of Boston, than I
be. And does he ask my advice when he's got something
up his sleeve? No, he don't! And yet I'll leave it to
Arnold, here, if my nose ain't keener to scent sour milk
than any nose in Topham&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>The idea of Sim Muzzy's advice on any matter of
greater importance than the condition of an egg or the
sweetness of milk, in determining which, to do him justice,
he was entirely competent, struck me as so funny that I
almost sniggered. Nor could I have restrained myself,
even so, when I perceived Arnold looking at me solemnly
and as if reproachfully, had not Uncle Seth just then
opened the door and called, "Sim, there's a lady here
wants some calico and spices. Come and wait on her."</p>

<p>When, fifteen minutes later, Sim returned, closing the
door smartly behind him, Arnold asked with a droll quirk,
which I alone perceived, "Well, my friend, what did you
gather during your stay in yonder?"</p>

<p>"Gather? Gather?" Sim spluttered. "I gathered nothing.
There was talk of dollars and cents and pounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
pence, and stocks and oils, and ships and horses, and
though I listened till my head swam, all I could make out
was when Neil Gleazen told me to shut the door behind
my back. If they was to ask my advice, I'd tell 'em to
talk sense, that's what I'd do."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sim," said Arnold, "if only they were to ask thy
advice, what advice thee would give them!"</p>

<p>"Now you're talking like a Quaker," Sim replied hotly.
"Why do Quakers talk that way, I'd like to know. Thee-ing
and thou-ing till it is enough to fuddle a sober man's
wits. I declare they are almost as bad as people in foreign
parts who, I've heard tell, have such a queer way of talking
that an honest man can't at all understand what
they're saying until he's got used to it."</p>

<p>"Such, indeed, is the way of the inconsiderate world,
Sim," Arnold dryly replied.</p>

<p>Then the three of us put our shoulders to a hogshead,
and in the mighty effort of lifting it to the bulkhead sill
ceased to talk.</p>

<p>As we finally raised it and shoved it into the yard, Sim
stepped farther out than Arnold and I, and looking toward
the street, whispered, "He's going."</p>

<p>I sprang over beside him and saw that the visitor, having
already unhitched his horse, was shaking hands with
Uncle Seth. Stepping into the chaise, he then drove off.</p>

<p>For a space of time so long that the man must have
come to the bend in the road, Uncle Seth and Cornelius
Gleazen watched him as he went; then, to puzzle us still
further, smiling broadly, they shook hands, and turning
about, still entirely unaware that we were watching
them, walked with oddly pleased expressions back into the
store.</p>

<p>My uncle's face expressed such confidence and friendliness
as even I had seldom seen on it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now ain't that queer?" Sim began. "If Seth Upham
was a little less set in his ways, I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a shrug Arnold Lamont broke in upon what
seemed likely to be a long harangue, and made a comment
that was much more to the point. "Now," said he, "we
are going to hear what has happened."</p>

<p>Surely enough, we thought. No sooner were we back in
the store, all three of us, than the door opened and in came
Uncle Seth.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, brusquely, and yet with a certain
pleased expression still lingering about his eyes, "I expected
you to have done more. Hm! Well, work hard.
We must have things in order come morning."</p>

<p>Arnold smiled as my uncle promptly returned to the
front room, but Sim and I were keenly disappointed.</p>

<p>"How now, you who are so clever?" Sim cried when
Uncle Seth again had closed the door. "How now, Arnold?
We have heard nothing."</p>

<p>"Why," said Arnold, imperturbably, "not exactly
'nothing.' We have learned that the man is coming back
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?" Sim responded. "Seth Upham said
nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>Arnold only smiled again. "Wait and see," he said.</p>

<p>So we worked until late at night, putting all once more
to rights; and in the morning, true to Arnold's prophecy,
the gentleman with the big black horse, accompanied now
by a friend, made a second visit in the front room of the
store.</p>

<p>This time he talked but briefly with Uncle Seth and
Neil Gleazen, who had already waited an hour for his
arrival. As if eager to see our business for himself, he then
walked through the store, examining every little detail of
the stock and fixtures, and asked a vast number of questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
which in themselves showed that he knew what he
was about and that he was determined to get at the bottom
of our affairs. There was talk of barrels of Alexandria
superfine flour and hogsheads of Kentucky tobacco; of
teas&mdash;Hyson, young Hyson, Hyson skin, Powchong and
Souchong; of oil, summer and winter; of Isles of Shoals dun
fish and Holland gin and preserved ginger, and one thing
and another, until, with answering the questions they
asked me, I was fairly dizzy.</p>

<p>Having examined store and stock to his satisfaction,
he then went with Uncle Seth, to my growing wonder, up
to our own house; and from what Sim reported when he
came back from a trip to spy upon them, they examined
the house with the same care. In due course they returned
to the store and sat down at the desk, and then the friend
who accompanied our first visitor wrote for some time on
an official-looking document; Uncle Seth and the strange
gentleman signed it; Arnold Lamont, whom they summoned
for the purpose, and Cornelius Gleazen witnessed
it; and all four drove away together, the gentleman and
his friend in their chaise and Uncle Seth and Neil Gleazen
in our own.</p>

<p>"When Seth Upham returns," said Arnold, "we shall
be told all."</p>

<p>And it was so.</p>

<p>Coming back alone in the late afternoon, Uncle Seth and
Gleazen left the chaise at the door, and entering, announced
that we should close the store early that day.
Gleazen was radiant with good-nature, and there was the
odor of liquor on his breath. Uncle Seth, on the contrary,
appeared not to have tasted a drop. He was, if anything,
a little sharper than ever at one moment, a little more jovial
at the next, excited always, and full of some mysterious
news that seemed both to delight and to frighten him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Obediently we fastened the shutters and drew the shades
and made ready for the night.</p>

<p>"Now, lads," said Uncle Seth, "come in by my desk and
take chairs. I have news for you."</p>

<p>Exchanging glances, we did so. Even Sim Muzzy was
silent now.</p>

<p>We all sat down together, Uncle Seth and Neil Gleazen
at the desk, Arnold Lamont and I a little at one side, and
Sim Muzzy tilting back importantly at a point from which
he could watch us all.</p>

<p>At the time I thought what an interesting study in character
the others made; but since then I have come to
think that by my own attitude toward them I revealed
more of the manner of youth I myself was, than by their
bearing they revealed of the manner of men they were.
There was Neil Gleazen, who held his cigar in his left
hand and, with the finger on which his great diamond
flashed, knocked each bit of ash on the floor so promptly
after it formed, that the glowing coal of fire seemed to eat
into the dark tobacco and leave no residue whatever. I
was confident that he thought more of me both for my
good fellowship and for my sound sense than he thought
of any of the others present&mdash;or in town, for that matter!
As for Uncle Seth, who was at once nervous and
elated, I must confess, although it did not take me long
to learn enough to be heartily ashamed of it, that I was
just a little inclined in my own mind to patronize him;
for although all my excellent prospects came entirely from
his shrewd labors, I felt that he was essentially the big
toad in the small puddle.</p>

<p>With the others, I smiled at Sim Muzzy. But with regard
to Arnold Lamont I was less confident. There had
been a world of philosophy in his brief remark that a man
does not tell all he knows; and my fencing bout with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
was still too fresh in my mind to permit me actually to
patronize him. He sat now with his thoughtful eyes intent
on my uncle, and of the five of us he was by long odds
the most composed.</p>

<p>Although I have betrayed my vanity in a none too flattering
light, it would be unjust, I truly think, not to add,
at the risk of seeming to contradict myself, that I was
instinctively kind-hearted, and that I did not lack for
courage.</p>

<p>"I have news for you, boys," Uncle Seth began, with a
manner at once abrupt and a little pompous, but with a
warm smile at me. "I hope you'll be glad to hear it, although
it means a radical change in the life we've lived
together for so many years. First of all, I want to say that
each of you will be well looked after."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth paused and glanced at Cornelius Gleazen,
who nodded as if to encourage him to go on.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will be well looked after, however it may appear
at first flush. I'll see that no faithful man suffers to
my profit, even though I have sold the store."</p>

<p>"What's that? You've sold the store?" Sim wildly
broke in. "If you've&mdash;you've gone and sold the store?
What&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Be still, Sim," Uncle Seth interposed. "Yes, I have
sold the store. I know that Joe'll not be surprised to hear
it; but even he has had only the vaguest hint of what's
going forward. The gentleman who was here yesterday
and to-day, has bought me out, store and house, lock,
stock, and barrel."</p>

<p>"The house!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Uncle Seth shortly.</p>

<p>"But what'll I do? And Arnold? And Joe?" Sim demanded.
"Oh, Seth Upham! Never did I think to see
this day and hear them words."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm coming to that," said Uncle Seth. "There'll be
room here for the three of you if you want to stay, and
there'll be work in abundance in the store; but&mdash;ah,
lads, here's the chance for you!&mdash;there'll be room for
you with me, if you wish to come. I have bought a
ship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A brig," Cornelius Gleazen put in.</p>

<p>"A brig," said Uncle Seth, accepting the correction.
"The Adventure, a very tidy little craft, and well named."</p>

<p>Cornelius Gleazen gave his cigar a harder flick and in a
reminiscent voice again forced his way into the conversation.
"Ninety-seven foot on deck, twenty-four foot beam,
sixteen foot deep, and a good two hundred and fifty ton,
built of white oak and copper fastened. Baltimore bow
and beautiful rake. Trim as a gull and fast as a duck.
Tidy's the word, Seth, tidy."</p>

<p>Gleazen's fingers were twitching and his eyes were
strangely alight.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Uncle Seth, sharply.</p>

<p>"But that's not all," Gleazen insisted.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" Uncle Seth demanded. "Are you
going to tell 'em everything?"</p>

<p>At this Gleazen paused and looked hard at his cigar.
His fingers, I could see, were twitching more than ever.</p>

<p>"No," he slowly said, "not everything. Go ahead,
Seth."</p>

<p>"If you keep putting in, how can I go ahead."</p>

<p>"Oh, stow it!" Gleazen suddenly roared. "This is no
piffling storekeeper's game. Go on!"</p>

<p>As you can imagine, we were all eyes and ears at this
brush between the two; and when Gleazen lost his temper
and burst out so hotly, in spite of my admiration for
the man, I hoped, and confidently expected, to see Uncle
Seth come back, hammer and tongs, and give him as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
as he sent. Instead, he suddenly turned white and became
strangely calm, and in a low, subdued voice went on
to the rest of us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We shall take on a cargo at Boston and sail for the
West Indies, where we shall add a few men to the crew
and thence sail for Africa. I'm sure the voyage will yield
a good profit and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Seth, O Seth!" cried Gleazen, abruptly. "That is
no manner of way to talk to the boys. Let me tell 'em!"</p>

<p>My uncle, at this, drew back in his chair and said with
great dignity, "Sir, whose money is financing this venture?"</p>

<p>"Money?" Gleazen roared with laughter. "What's
money without brains? I'll tell 'em? You sit tight."</p>

<p>We were all but dumbfounded. White of face and blue
of lip, Seth Upham sat in his chair&mdash;<i>his no longer!</i>&mdash;and
Gleazen told us.</p>

<p>He threw his cigar-butt on the floor and stepped on it,
and drummed on his beaver hat with nimble fingers.</p>

<p>"It's like this, lads," he said in a voice that implied
that he was confiding in us: "I've come home here to
Topham with a fortune, to be sure, and I've come to end
my days in the town that gave me birth. But&mdash;" his
voice now fell almost to a whisper&mdash;"I've left a king's
wealth on the coast of Guinea."</p>

<p>He paused to see the effect of his words. I could hear
my uncle breathing hard, but I held my eyes intently on
Neil Gleazen's face.</p>

<p>"A fit treasure for an emperor!" he whispered, in such
a way that the words came almost hissing to our ears.</p>

<p>Still we sat in silence and stared at him.</p>

<p>"With three good men to guard it," he went on after
another pause. "Three tried, true men&mdash;friends of mine,
every one of them. Suppose I <i>have</i> made my fortune and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
come home to end my days in comfort? I'd as soon have
a little more, <i>hadn't you</i>? And I'd as soon give a hand to
a hard-working, honest boyhood friend, <i>hadn't you</i>?
Here's what I done: I said to Seth Upham, who has robbed
many a church with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that, I thought my uncle was going to cry out in
protest or denial; but his words died in his throat.</p>

<p>"I said to him, 'Seth, you and me is old friends. Now
here's this little scheme. I've got plenty myself, so I'll
gladly share with you. If you'll raise the money for this
venture, you'll be helping three good men to get their
little pile out of the hands of heathen savages, and half of
the profits will be yours.' So he says he'll raise money for
the venture, and he done so, and he's sold his store and
his house, and now he can't back down. How about it,
Seth?"</p>

<p>My uncle gulped, but made no reply. Gleazen, who up
to this point had been always deferential and considerate,
seemed, out of a clear sky, suddenly to have assumed
absolute control of our united fortunes.</p>

<p>"Of course it won't do to turn off old friends," he continued.
"So he made up his mind to give you lads your
choice of coming with us at handsome pay&mdash;one third of
his lay is to be divided amongst those of you that come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I never said that," Uncle Seth cried, as if startled
into speech.</p>

<p>"You never?" Gleazen returned in seeming amazement.
"The papers is signed, Seth."</p>

<p>"But I never said that!"</p>

<p>Gleazen turned on my uncle, his eyes blazing. "This
from you!" he cried with a crackling oath. "After all I've
done! I swear <i>I'll</i> back out now&mdash;then where'll you be?
What's more, I'll tell what I know."</p>

<p>My uncle in a dazed way looked around the place that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
up to now had been his own little kingdom and uttered
some unintelligible murmur.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Gleazen, "I thought you did." Then, as if
Uncle Seth had not broken in upon him, as if he had not
retorted at Uncle Seth, as if his low, even voice had not
been raised in pitch since he began, he went on, "Or, lads,
you can stay. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Still we sat and stared at him.</p>

<p>Sim Muzzy, as usual, was first to speak and last to
think. "I'll go," he exclaimed eagerly, "I'll go, for one."</p>

<p>"Good lad," said Gleazen, who, although they were
nearly of an age, outrageously patronized him.</p>

<p>With my familiar world torn down about my shoulders,
and the patrimony that I long had regarded as mine about
to be imperiled in this strange expedition, it seemed that I
must choose between a berth in the new vessel and a
clerkship with no prospects. It was not a difficult choice
for a youth with a leaning toward adventure, nor was I
altogether unprepared for it. Then, too, there was something
in me that would not suffer me lightly to break all
ties with my mother's only brother. After a moment for
reflection, I said, "I'll go, for two."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Arnold Lamont had been studying us all
and had seen, I am confident, more than any of us. He
had taken time to notice to the full the sudden return of all
Cornelius Gleazen's arrogance and the extraordinary meekness
of Uncle Seth who, without serious affront, had just
now taken words from Gleazen for which he would once
have blazed out at him in fury.</p>

<p>It did not take Arnold Lamont's subtlety to see that
Gleazen, by some means or other, had got Seth Upham
under his thumb and was taking keen pleasure in feeling
him there. Gleazen's attitude toward my uncle had undergone
a curious series of changes since the day when, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
first time, I had seen him enter our store: from arrogance
he had descended to courtesy, even to deference; but from
deference he had now returned again to arrogance. In
his attitude on that first day there had been much of the
cool insolence that he now manifested; but after a few
days it had seemed to a certain extent to have vanished.
Rather, the consideration with which he had of late
treated my uncle had been so great as to make this new
impudence the more amazing.</p>

<p>Many things may have influenced Arnold in his decision;
but among them, I think, were his gratitude to Uncle Seth,
who had taken him in and given him a good living, and
who, we both could see, was likely now to need the utmost
that a friend could give him; his friendliness for Sim and
me, with whom he had worked so long; and, which I did
not at the time suspect, the desire of a keen, able, straight-forward
man to meet and beat Cornelius Gleazen at his
own game.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," he quietly said.</p>

<p>"Good lads!" Gleazen cried.</p>

<p>"One thing more," said I.</p>

<p>"Anything&mdash;anything&mdash;within reason, aye, or without."</p>

<p>"Uncle Seth once spoke to me of selling out Abraham
Guptil."</p>

<p>My uncle now bestirred himself and, shaking off the discomfiture
with which he had received Gleazen's earlier
words, said with something of his usual sharpness, "The
sheriff has had the papers these three days."</p>

<p>"Then," I cried, "I beg you, as a favor, let him have a
berth with us."</p>

<p>"What's that? Some farmer?" Gleazen demanded.</p>

<p>"He's bred to the sea," I returned.</p>

<p>"That puts another face on the matter," said Gleazen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said my uncle. "But his lay comes out of the
part that goes to you, then."</p>

<p>"But," I responded, "I thought of his signing on at regular
wages." Then I blushed at my own selfishness and
hastened to add, "Never mind that. I for one will say
that he shall share alike with us."</p>

<p>And the others, knowing his plight, agreed as with a
single voice.</p>

<p>"Now, then, my lads," Cornelius Gleazen cried, "a
word in confidence: to the village and to the world we'll
say that we are going on a trading voyage. And so we
are! All this rest of our talk," he continued slowly and
impressively, "all this rest of our talk is a secret between
you four and me and God Almighty." He brought his
great fist down on the desk with a terrific bang. "If any
one of you four men&mdash;I don't care a tinker's damn
which one&mdash;lets this story leak, I'll kill him."</p>

<p>At the time I did not think that he meant it; since then
I have come to think that he did.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="small">A WILD NIGHT</span></h3>

<p>Unless you have lived in a little town where every
man's business is his neighbor's, you cannot imagine the
furor in the village of Topham when our fellow citizens
learned that Seth Upham had actually sold his business
and his house, and was to embark with Cornelius Gleazen
on a voyage of speculation to the West Indies and Africa.
The friction with Great Britain that had closed ports in
the West Indies to American ships added zest to their surmises;
and the unexpected news that that very worthy
gentleman, Cornelius Gleazen, who had so recently returned
to his old home, was so soon to depart again, sharpened
their regrets. All were united in wishing us good fortune
and a safe, speedy return; all were keenly interested
in whatever hints of the true character of the voyage we
let fall, which you can be sure were few and slender. It
was such an extraordinary affair in the annals of the village,
that the more enterprising began to prepare for a
grand farewell, which should express their feelings in a
suitable way and should do honor both to their respected
fellow townsman, Seth Upham, and to their distinguished
resident, Cornelius Gleazen.</p>

<p>There was to be a parade, with a band from Boston at
its head, a great dinner at the town hall, to which with
uncommon generosity they invited even the doubting
blacksmith, and a splendid farewell ceremony, with
speeches by the minister and the doctor, and with presentations
to all who were to leave town. It was to mark
an epoch in the history of Topham. Nothing like it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
ever taken place in all the country round. And as we
were to go to Boston in the near future,&mdash;the man who
had bought out Uncle Seth was to take over the house and
store almost at once,&mdash;they set the date for the first Saturday
in September.</p>

<p>Because I, in a way, was to be one of the guests of the
occasion, I heard little of the plans directly, for they were
supposed to be secret, in order to surprise us by their splendor.
But a less curious lad than I could not have helped
noticing the long benches carried past the store and the
platform that was building on the green.</p>

<p>The formal farewell, as I have said, was to take place
on the first Saturday in September, and the following
Wednesday we five were to leave town. But meanwhile,
in order to have everything ready for our departure, and
because we needed another pair of hands to help in the
work during the last days at the store, I went on Friday to
get Abraham Guptil to join us.</p>

<p>He had been so pleased at the chance to ship for a voyage,
thus to recover a little of the goods and gear that misfortune
had swept away from him almost to the last stick
and penny, that I was more than glad I had given him the
chance. Well satisfied, accordingly, with myself and the
world, I turned my uncle's team toward the home of Abe's
father-in-law, where Mrs. Guptil and the boy were to stay
until Abe should return from the voyage; and when I
passed the green, where the great platform was almost
finished, I thought with pleasure of what an important
part I was to play in the ceremonies next day.</p>

<p>It was a long ride to the home of Abraham Guptil's
father-in-law, and the way led through the pines and
marshes beside the sea, and up hill and down valley over
a winding road inland. The goldenrod beside the stone
walls along the road was a bright yellow, and the blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
frost flowers were beginning to blossom. In the air, which
was as clear as on a winter night, was the pleasant, almost
indescribable tang of autumn, in which are blended
so mysteriously the mellow odors of stubble fields and
fallen leaves, and fruit that is ready for the market; it suggested
bright foliage and mellow sunsets, and blue smoke
curling up from chimneys, and lighted windows in the
early dusk.</p>

<p>On the outward journey, but partly occupied by driving
the well-broken team, I thought of how Neil Gleazen,
before my very eyes, had at first frightened Uncle Seth,
and had then cajoled him, and, finally, had completely
won him over. I had never put it in so many words before,
that Gleazen had got my uncle into such a state that
he could do what he wished with him; but to me it was
plain enough, and I suspected that Arnold Lamont saw it,
too. Although I had watched Gleazen from the moment
when he first began to accomplish the purpose toward
which he had been plotting, I could not understand what
power he held over Uncle Seth that had so changed my
uncle's whole character. Then I fell to thinking of that
remark, twice repeated, about robbing churches, and meditated
on it while the horses quietly jogged along. Never,
I thought, should the people of the town learn of my suspicions;
they concerned a family matter, and I would keep
them discreetly to myself.</p>

<p>It was touching to see Abraham Guptil bid farewell to
his wife and son. Their grief was so unaffected that it almost
set me sniffling, and I feared that poor Abe would
make a dreary addition to our little band; but when we
had got out of sight of the house, he began to pick up, and
after wiping his eyes and blowing his nose, he surprised
me by becoming, all things considered, quite lively.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "you can tell me all about this voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
for which I've shipped. It seems queer for a man to sign
the articles when he don't know where his lay is coming
from, but, I declare, it was a godsend to me to have a voyage
and wages in prospect, and you were a rare good friend
of mine, Joe, to put my name in like you done."</p>

<p>It puzzled me to know just how much to tell him, but I
explained as well as I could that it was a trading voyage
to the West Indies and Africa, and gave him a hint that
there was a secret connected with it whereby, if all went
well, we were to get large profits, and let him know that
he was to share a certain proportion of this extra money
with Arnold, Sim, and me, in addition to the wages that
we all were to draw.</p>

<p>It seemed to satisfy him, and after thinking it over, he
said, "I've heard Seth Upham was getting all his money
together for some reason or other. There must be more
than enough to buy the Adventure. He's been cashing in
notes and mortgages all over the county, and I'm told the
bank is holding it for him in gold coin."</p>

<p>"In gold!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Gold coin," he repeated. "It's rumored round the
county that Neil Gleazen's holding something over him
that's frightened him into doing this and that, exactly
according to order."</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>It was so precisely what I myself had been thinking that
it seemed as if I must have talked too freely; yet I knew
that I had held my tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh, one place and another," he replied. Then, changing
the subject, he remarked, "There'll be a grand time
in town to-morrow, what with speeches and all. I'd like
to have brought my wife to see it, but I was afraid it
would make it harder for her when I leave."</p>

<p>"She doesn't want you to go?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, she's glad for me to have the chance, but she's no
hand to bear up at parting."</p>

<p>Conversing thus, we drove on into the twilight and falling
dusk, till we came so near the town that we could see
ahead of us the tavern, all alight and cheerful for the evening.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Abe cried eagerly, "who'll be sitting by
the table with a hot supper in front of him, and Nellie
Nuttles to fetch and carry."</p>

<p>I was hungry after my day's drive and could not help
sharing Abe's desire for a meal at the tavern, which was
known as far as Boston and beyond for its good food;
but I had no permission thus wantonly to spend Uncle
Seth's money, so I snapped the whip and was glad to
hear the louder rattling of wheels as the horses broke
into a brisk trot, which made our own supper seem appreciably
nearer.</p>

<p>And who, indeed, would be sitting now behind those
lighted windows? Abe's question came back to me as
we neared the tavern. The broad roofs seemed to suggest
the very essence of hospitality, and as if to indorse their
promise of good fare, a roar of laughter came out into
the night.</p>

<p>As we passed, I looked through one of the windows that
but a moment since had been rattling from the mirth
within, and saw&mdash;I looked again and made sure that I
was not mistaken!&mdash;saw Neil Gleazen, red-faced and
wild-eyed, standing by the bar with a glass raised in his
hand.</p>

<p>The sight surprised me, for although Gleazen, like almost
everyone else in old New England, took his wine regularly,
in all the months since his return he had conducted
himself so soberly that there had been not the slightest
suggestion that he ever got himself the worse for liquor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and even more it amazed me to see beside him one Jed
Matthews who was, probably, the most unscrupulous
member of the lawless crew with whom Gleazen was said
to have associated much in the old days, but of whom he
had seen, everyone believed, almost nothing since he had
come home.</p>

<p>As we drove on past the blacksmith shop, I saw the
smith smoking his pipe in the twilight.</p>

<p>"It's a fine evening," I called.</p>

<p>"It is," said he, coming into the road. And in a lower
voice he added, "Did you see him when you passed the
inn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, knowing well enough whom he meant.</p>

<p>"They've called me a fool," the smith responded, "but
before this night's over we'll see who's a fool." He
puffed away at his pipe and looked at me significantly.
"We'll see who's a fool, I or them that has so much more
money and wisdom than I."</p>

<p>He went back and sat down, and Abe and I drove on,
puzzled and uncomfortable. The smith was vindictive.
Could he, I wondered, be right?</p>

<p>A good supper was keeping hot for us in the brick oven,
and we sat down to it with the good-will that it merited;
but before we were more than half through, my uncle burst
in upon us. He seemed harassed by anxiety, and went at
once to the window, where he stood looking out into the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything said around town?" he presently
demanded, more sharply, it seemed to me, than ever.</p>

<p>"I've heard little since I got back," I returned. "Only
the smith's ravings. He was in an ill temper as we passed.
But I saw Neil Gleazen at the inn drinking with Jed
Matthews."</p>

<p>"The ungrateful reprobate!" Uncle Seth cried with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
angry gesture. "He's drawn me into this thing hand and
foot&mdash;hand and foot. I'm committed. It's too late to
withdraw, and he knows it. And now, now for the first
time, mind you, he's starting on one of his old sprees."</p>

<p>"He's not a hard drinker," I said. "In all the time he's
been in Topham he's not been the worse for liquor, and
this evening, so far as I could see, he was just taking a
glass&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't know him as he used to be," my uncle cried.</p>

<p>"A glass," put in Abe Guptil; "but with Jed Matthews!"</p>

<p>"You've hit the nail on the head," Uncle Seth burst
out&mdash;"with Jed Matthews. God save we're ruined by
this night's work. If he should go out to Higgleby's barn
with that gang of thieves, my good name will go too. I
swear I'll sell the brig."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth wildly paced the room and scowled until
every testy wrinkle on his face was drawn into one huge
knot that centred in his forehead.</p>

<p>The only sounds, as Abe and I sat watching him in silence,
were the thumping of his feet as he walked and the
hoarse whisper of his breathing. Plainly, he was keyed up
to a pitch higher than ever I had seen him.</p>

<p>At that moment, from far beyond the village, shrilly
but faintly, came a wild burst of drunken laughter. It was
a single voice and one strange to me. There was something
devilish in its piercing, unrestrained yell.</p>

<p>"Merciful heavens!" Uncle Seth cried,&mdash;actually his
hand was shaking like the palsy; a note of fear in his
strained voice struck to my heart like a finger of ice,&mdash;"I'd
know that sound if I heard it in the shrieking of hell;
and I have not heard Neil Gleazen laugh like that in
thirty years. Come, boys, maybe we can stop him before
it's too late."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Thrusting his fingers through his hair so that it stood
out on all sides in disorder, he wildly dashed from the
room.</p>

<p>Springing up, Abe and I followed him outdoors and
down the road. We ran with a will, but old though he
was, a frenzy of fear and anxiety and shame led him on at
a pace we could scarcely equal. Down the long road into
town we ran, all three, breathing harder and harder as
we went, past the store, the parsonage, and the church,
and past the smithy, where someone called to us and
hurried out to stop us.</p>

<p>It was the smith, who loomed up big and black and ominous
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"They've gone," he said, "they've gone to Higgleby's
barn."</p>

<p>"Who?" my uncle demanded. "Who? Say who! For
heaven's sake don't keep me here on tenterhooks!"</p>

<p>"Neil Gleazen," said the smith, "and Jed Matthews
and all the rest. Ah, you wouldn't listen to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"And all the rest!" Uncle Seth echoed weakly.</p>

<p>For a moment he reeled as if bewildered, even dazed.
Whatever it was that had come over him, it seemed to
have pierced to some unsuspected weakness in the fibre
of the man, some spot so terribly sensitive that he was
fairly crazed by the thrust. To Abe and me, both of us
shocked and appalled, he turned with the madness of despair
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said hoarsely, "we've got to be ready to
leave. Call Sim and Arnold! Hitch up the horses! Pack
my bag and&mdash;and, Joe,"&mdash;he laid his hand on my shoulder
and whispered in my ear, a mere trembling breath of a
whisper,&mdash;"here's the key to the house safe. Pack all
that's in it in the bed of the wagon while the others are
busy elsewhere. O Joe! what a wretched man I am! Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in heaven's name could he not walk straight for just one
day more?"</p>

<p>Why, indeed? I thought. But I remembered Higgleby's
barn, and in my own heart I knew the reason. Secretly, all
this time, Neil Gleazen had been hand in glove with his
old disreputable cronies; now that he had got Uncle Seth
so far committed to this new venture that he could not
desert it, Gleazen was entirely willing to throw away his
hard-won reputation for integrity, for the sake of one farewell
fling with the "old guard."</p>

<p>"Go, lads," Uncle Seth cried; "go quickly." He rested
a shaking hand on my arm as Abe turned away. "My
poor, poor boy!" he murmured. "I've meant to do so
well by you, Joey! Heaven keep us all!"</p>

<p>"But you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going, if I can, to bring Neil Gleazen back before
it is too late," Uncle Seth replied. And with that he set
off into the darkness.</p>

<p>As we turned back to the store to rouse up Arnold
and Sim, I caught a glimpse of the stark white platform
on the green, which was visible even in the darkness, and
ironically I thought of the farewell ceremonies that were
to take place next day.</p>

<p>I shall never forget how the store looked that night, as
Abe and I came hurrying up to it. The shadows on the
porch were as black as ink, and the shuttered windows
seemed to stare like the sightless eyes of a blind man who
hears a familiar voice and turns as if to see whence it
comes. From the windows of the room above, which
Arnold and Sim occupied, there shone a few thin shafts of
light along the edges of the shades, and the window frames
divided the shades themselves into small yellow squares,
on which a shadow came and went as one of the men
moved about the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>In reply to our cries and knocks, Arnold raised the curtain
and we saw first his head, then Sim's, black against
the lighted room.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" he called, "and what's wanted?"</p>

<p>Almost before we had finished pouring out our story,
Arnold was downstairs and fumbling at the bolts of the
door; and as we entered the dark store, Sim, his shoes in
his hand, followed him, even more than usually grotesque
in the light from above.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Arnold, calmly, "let us now, all
four, prove to ourselves and to Seth Upham, the mettle
that is in us."</p>

<p>We lost no time in idle speculation. Dividing among us
all that was to be done, we fell to with a will. Working
like men possessed, we packed our own possessions and
Uncle Seth's, both at the store and at the barn; and while
the others were still busy in the carriage-shed, I hurried
back to the house and opened the safe, and brought out
bags of money and papers and heaven knows what, and as
secretly as possible packed them in the bottom of the
wagon. For three hours we toiled at one place and the
other; then, hot, tired, excited, apprehensive of we knew
not what, we rested by the wagon and waited.</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything so rattle-headed in all my
life," Sim Muzzy cried, when he had caught his breath.
"Seth Upham gets crazier every day. Here all's ready for
the grand farewell to-morrow and all of us to be there, and
not one of us to leave town until next week, and yet he
gets us up at all hours of the night as if we was to start
come sunrise. I'm not going to run away at such an hour,
I can tell you. Why it may be they'll call on me to make
a speech! Who knows?"</p>

<p>"We'll be lucky, I fear," said Arnold Lamont, "if we
do not start before sunrise."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before sunrise! Well, I'll have you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>I simply could not endure Sim's interminable talk.
"Watch the goods and the wagon, you three," I said.
"I'm going to look for Uncle Seth and see what he wants
us to do next."</p>

<p>Before they could object, I had left them sitting by the
wagon and the harnessed horses, ready for no one knew
what, and had made off into the night. Having done all
that I could to carry out my uncle's orders, I had no intention
of returning until I had solved the mystery of
Higgleby's barn.</p>

<p>I hurried along and used every short cut that I knew;
and though I now stumbled in the darkness, now fell headlong
on the dewy grass, now barked my shins as I scrambled
over a barway, I made reasonably good progress, all
things considered, and came in less than half an hour to
the pasture where Higgleby's lonely barn stood. The door
of the barn, as I saw it from a distance, was open and
made a rectangle of yellow light against the black woods
beyond it. When I listened, I heard confused voices. As I
was about to advance toward the barn, a certain note in
the voices warned me that a quarrel was in progress. I
hesitated and stopped where I was, wondering whether to
go forward or not, and there I heard a strange sound and
saw a strange sight.</p>

<p>First there came a much louder outcry than any that
had gone before; then the light in the barn suddenly went
out; then I heard the sound of running back and forth;
then the light appeared again, but flickering and unsteady;
then a single harsh yell came all the way across the dark
pasture; then the light grew and grew and grew.</p>

<p>It threw its rays out over the pasture land and revealed
men running about like ants around a newly destroyed
hill. A tongue of flame crept out of one window and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
crawled up the side of the old building. A great wave of
fire came billowing out of the door. Sparks began to fly
and the roar and crackling grew louder and louder.</p>

<p>As I breathlessly ran toward the barn, from which now
I could see little streams of fire flowing in every direction
through the dry grass, I suddenly became aware that there
was someone ahead of me, and by stopping short I narrowly
escaped colliding with two men whom, with a sudden
shock, I recognized as my uncle and Neil Gleazen.</p>

<p>"Uncle Seth!" I gasped out.</p>

<p>Nothing then, I think, could have surprised Seth
Upham. There was only relief in his voice when he cried,
"Quick, Joe, quick, take his other arm."</p>

<p>Obediently, if reluctantly, I turned my back on the
conflagration behind us, and locking my right arm through
Neil Gleazen's left, helped partly to drag him, partly to
carry him toward the village and the tavern.</p>

<p>"I showed the villains!" Gleazen proclaimed thickly.
"The scoundrels! The despicable curs! I showed them
how a gentlemen replies to such as them. I showed them,
eh, Seth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Neil! Hush! Be still! There are people coming.
Merciful heavens! That fire will bring the whole
town out upon us."</p>

<p>"I showed them, the villains! the scoundrels! the despicable
curs! They are not used to the ways of gentlemen,
eh, Seth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but do be still! <i>Do, do</i> be still!"</p>

<p>"I showed them how a gentleman acts&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man was as drunk as a lord, but in his thick ravings
there was a fixed idea that sent a thrill of apprehension
running through me.</p>

<p>"Uncle Seth," I gasped, "Uncle Seth, <i>what has he
done</i>?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quick! quick! We must hurry!"</p>

<p>"What has he done?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Joe, never mind that now!"</p>

<p>For the moment I yielded, and we stumbled along, arm
in arm, with Gleazen now all but a dead weight between
us.</p>

<p>"I showed them!" he cried again. "I showed them!"</p>

<p>I simply could not ignore the strange muttering in his
voice.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I cried. "Uncle Seth, tell me what he has
done."</p>

<p>"Not yet! Not yet!"</p>

<p>"Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Not yet!"</p>

<p>"Or I'll not go another step!"</p>

<p>My uncle gasped and staggered. My importunity
seemed to be one thing more than he could bear, poor
man! and even in my temper, pity sobered me and cooled
my anger. For a moment he touched my wrist. His hand
was icy cold. But his face, when I looked at him, was set
and hard, and my temper flashed anew.</p>

<p>"Not another step! Tell me."</p>

<p>Glancing apprehensively about, my uncle gasped in a
hoarse undertone, "He has killed Jed Matthews."</p>

<p>As people were appearing now on all sides and running
to fight the fire, Uncle Seth and I tried our best to lead
Gleazen into a by-path and so home by a back way; but
with drunken obstinacy he refused to yield an inch. "No,
no," he roared, "I'm going to walk home past all the
people. I'm not afraid of them. If they say aught to me,
I'll show 'em."</p>

<p>So back we marched, supporting between us, hatless
but with the diamonds still flashing on his finger and in
his stock, that maudlin wretch, Cornelius Gleazen. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
my own face redden as the curious turned to stare at us,
and for Uncle Seth it was a sad and bitter experience; but
we pushed on as fast as we could go, driven always by
fear of what would follow when the people should learn
the whole story of the brawl in the burning barn.</p>

<p>Back into the village we came, now loitering for a moment
in the deeper shadows to avoid observation, now
pushing at top speed across a lighter open space, always
dragging Cornelius Gleazen between us, and so up to the
open door of the tavern.</p>

<p>"Now," murmured Uncle Seth, "heaven send us help!
Neil, Neil&mdash;Neil, I say!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We must get your chests and run. Your money, your
papers&mdash;are they packed?"</p>

<p>"Money? What money?"</p>

<p>"Your fortune! You can never come back here. Sober
up, Neil, sober up! You killed Jed Matthews."</p>

<p>"Served him right. Despicable cur, villain, scoundrel!
I'll show them."</p>

<p>"Neil, Neil Gleazen!" cried my uncle, now all but
frantic.</p>

<p>"Well, I hear you."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, will he not listen to reason? Take his arm
again, Joe."</p>

<p>We lifted him up the steps and led him into the inn, and
there in the door of the bar-room came face to face with
the landlord, who was hot with anger.</p>

<p>"Don't bring him in here, Mr. Upham," he cried; "I
keep no house for sots and swine."</p>

<p>"What!" gasped my uncle, "you'll not receive him?"</p>

<p>"Not I!"</p>

<p>"But what's come over you? <i>But you never would treat
Mr. Gleazen like this!</i>"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, but, but!" the landlord snarled. "This very
night he threw my good claret in my own face and called
it a brew for pigs. Let him seek his lodgings elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Where are his chests, then?" my uncle demanded.
"We'll take his chests and go."</p>

<p>"Not till he's paid my bill."</p>

<p>For a moment we stood at deadlock, Uncle Seth and I,
with Gleazen between us, and the landlord in the bar-room
door. Every sound from outside struck terror to us lest
the village had discovered the worst; lest at any moment
we should have the people about our ears. But the landlord,
who, of course, knew nothing of what had been going
forward all this time, and Gleazen, who seemed too drunk
to care, were imperturbable, until Gleazen raised his head
and with inflamed eyes stared at the man.</p>

<p>"Who's a swine?" he demanded. "Who's a sot?"</p>

<p>Lurching forward, he broke away from us and crashed
against the landlord and knocked him into the bar-room,
whither he himself followed.</p>

<p>"You blackfaced bla'guard!" the landlord cried; and,
raising a chair, he started to bring it down on Gleazen's
head.</p>

<p>I had thought that the man was too drunk to move
quickly, but now, as if a new brawl were all that he needed
to bring him again to his faculties, he stepped back like a
flash and raised his hand.</p>

<p>A sharp, hook-like instrument used to pull corks was
kept stuck into the beam above his head, where, so often
was it used, it had worn a hollow place nearly as big as a
bowl. This he seized and, holding it like a foil, lunged at
the landlord as the chair descended.</p>

<p>The chair struck Gleazen on the head and knocked him
down, but the cork-puller went into the landlord's shoulder,
and when Gleazen, clutching it as he fell, pulled it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
again, the hooked end tore a great hole in the muscles,
from which blood spurted.</p>

<p>Clapping his hand to the wound, the landlord went
white and leaned back against the bar; but Gleazen, having
received a blow that might have killed a horse, got up
nimbly and actually appeared to be sobered by the shock.
Certainly he thought clearly and spoke to a purpose.</p>

<div class="p2 figcenter">
<img src="images/illus_0382.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="Landlord leaning against the bar." /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Clapping his hand to the wound the landlord went white and leaned
back against the bar.</i></p>

<p>"Now, by heaven!" he cried, "I <i>have</i> got to leave
town. Come, Seth, come, Joe."</p>

<p>"But your chests! Your money!" my uncle repeated in
a dazed way. The events of the night were quite too much
for his wits.</p>

<p>"Let him keep them for the bill," said Gleazen with a
harsh laugh. "Come, I say!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come! Hear that?"</p>

<p>"Watch the back door," someone was crying. "He's
probably dead drunk, but he's a dangerous man and we
can't take chances."</p>

<p>It was the constable's voice.</p>

<p>Gleazen was already running through the long hall, and
we followed him at our best speed.</p>

<p>As we left the room, the landlord fell and carried down
with a crash a table on which a tray of glasses was standing.
I would have stayed to help him, but I knew that
other help was near, and to tell the truth I was beginning
to fear the consequences of even so slight a part as mine
had been in the ghastly happenings of the night. So I
followed the others, and we noiselessly slipped away
through the orchard, just as the men sent to guard the
back door came hurrying round the house and took their
stations.</p>

<p>With the distant fire flaming against the sky, with the
smell of smoke stinging in our nostrils, and with the clamor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of the aroused town sounding on every side, we hurried,
unobserved, through dark fields and orchards, to my uncle's
house, where Arnold and Sim and Abe were impatiently
waiting.</p>

<p>They started up from beside the wagon as we drew near,
and crowded round us with eager questions. But there was
no time for mere talking. Already we could hear voices
approaching, although as yet they were not dangerously
near.</p>

<p>"Come, boys," my uncle cried, "into the wagon, every
one. Come, Neil, come&mdash;for heaven's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be still, Seth, I am sober."</p>

<p>"Sober!" Uncle Seth put a world of disgust into the
word.</p>

<p>"Yes, sober, curse you."</p>

<p>"Very well, but do climb in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Climb in? I'll climb in when it suits my convenience."</p>

<p>Jostling and scrambling, we were all in the wagon at
last. Uncle Seth held reins and whip; Neil Gleazen, who
was squeezed in between him and me on the seat, snored
loudly; and the others, finding such seats as they could on
boxes or the bed of the wagon, endured their discomfort in
silence.</p>

<p>The whip cracked, the horses started forward, the
wheels crunched in gravel and came out on the hard road.
Turning our backs on the village of Topham, we left behind
us the benches on the green, the fine new platform,
the banquet that was already half prepared, and all our
anticipations of the great farewell.</p>

<p>We went up the long hill, from the summit of which we
could see the lights of the town shining in the dark valley,
the great flare of fire at the burning barn, and the
country stretching for miles in every direction, and thence
we drove rapidly away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, for the second time, twenty years after the first,
Cornelius Gleazen left his native town as a fugitive from
justice. But this time the fortunes of five men were bound
up with his, and we whom he was leading on his mad quest
knew now only too well what we could expect of our
drunken leader.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="small">THE BRIG ADVENTURE</span></h3>

<p>We drove for a long time in silence, with the jolting of
the chaise and the terrible scenes behind us to occupy our
minds; and I assure you it was a grim experience. In all
the years that have intervened I have never been able to
escape from the memory of the burning barn, with the
dark figures running this way and that; the shrill cries of
Cornelius Gleazen, staring drunk, and his talk of the man
he had killed; the landlord at the tavern, with the blood
spurting from his shoulder where the hook had pulled
through the flesh.</p>

<p>In a night the whole aspect of the world had changed.
From a care-free, selfish, heedless youth, put to work despite
his wish to linger over books, I had become of a sudden
a companion of criminals, haunted by terrible memories,
and through no fault of my own. After all, I thought,
by whose fault was it? Cornelius Gleazen's, to be sure.
But by whose fault was I forced to accompany Cornelius
Gleazen in his flight? Certainly I was guiltless of any unlawful
act&mdash;for that matter, we all were, except Gleazen.
I had not a jot of sympathy for him, yet so completely had
he interwoven our affairs with his that, although the man
was a drunken beast, we dared not refuse to share his
flight. By whose fault? I again asked myself.</p>

<p>For a while I would not accept the answer that came to
me. It seemed disloyal to a well-meaning man who at one
time and another had given a thousand evidences of his
real affection for me, which underlay the veneer of sharpness
and irascibility that he presented to the world at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
large. It seemed to me that I could hear him saying
again, "You're all I've got, Joey; you're all that's left to
the old man and I 'm going to do well by you&mdash;"; that I
could hear again the clink of gold thrown down before me
on the table; that I could feel his hand again on my shoulder,
his voice again trembling with despair when he cried,
"I've meant to do so well by you, Joey! But now&mdash;heaven
keep us all!" Yet, as we jounced away over that
rough road and on into the night, and as I thought of
things that one and another had said, I felt more and more
confident that at bottom Seth Upham was to blame for
our predicament. To be sure, he had <i>meant</i> well, even in
this present undertaking; and though he was said to drive
sharp bargains, he lived, I well knew, an honest life. Yet
I was convinced that at some time in the past he must
have been guilty of some sin or other that gave Neil
Gleazen his hold over him. It fairly staggered me to think
of the power for good or evil that lies in every act in a
man's life. To be sure, had Seth Upham been a really
strong man, he would have lived down his mistake long
since, whatever it might have been, and would have defied
Gleazen to do his worst. But the crime, if such there was,
was his, none the less; and that it was the seed whence
had sprung our great misfortunes, I was convinced.</p>

<p>Looking back at Arnold Lamont, I caught his eye by
the light of the rising moon and found great comfort in his
steady glance. As if to reassure me further, he laid his
hand on my arm and slightly pressed it.</p>

<p>On and on and on we drove, past towns and villages,
over bridges and under arching trees, beside arms of the
sea and inland ponds, until, as dawn was breaking, we
came down the road into Boston, with the waters of the
Charles River and of the Back Bay on our left and Beacon
Hill before us.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Here and there in the town early risers were astir, and
the smoke climbed straight up from their chimneys; but
for the most part the people were still asleep, and the shops
that we passed were still shuttered, except one that an
apprentice at that very moment was opening for the day.
Down to the wharves we drove, whence we could see craft
of every description, both in dock and lying at anchor;
and there we fell into a lively discussion.</p>

<p>As the horses stopped, Gleazen woke, and that he was
sick and miserable a single glance at his face revealed.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "there's the brig."</p>

<p>"Yes," Uncle Seth retorted, "and if you had kept away
from Higgleby's barn, we'd not have seen her for a week
to come. We've got you out of that scrape with a whole
skin, and I swear we've done well."</p>

<p>"It was <i>sub rosa</i>," Gleazen responded thickly, "only
<i>sub rosa</i>, mind you. Under the rose&mdash;you know, Seth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. If I had had my wits about me, you
would never have pulled the wool over my eyes."</p>

<p>Gleazen laughed unpleasantly. It was plain that he was
in an evil temper, and Uncle Seth, worn and harassed by
the terrible experiences of the night, was in no mood to
humor him. So we sat in the wagon on a wharf by the
harbor, where the clean salt water licked at the piling and
rose slowly with the incoming tide, while our two leaders
bickered together.</p>

<p>At last, in anger, Seth Upham cried: "I swear I'll not
go. I'll hold back the brig. I'll keep my money. You
shall hang."</p>

<p>Gleazen laughed a low laugh that was more threatening
by far than if as usual he had laughed with a great roar.
"No, you don't, Seth," he quietly said. "You know the
stakes that you've put up and you know that the winnings
will be big. I've used you right, and you're not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to go back on me now&mdash;<i>not while I know what I know</i>!
There's them that would open their eyes to hear it, Seth.
I've bore the blame for thirty years, but the end's come if
you try to go back on me now."</p>

<p>I looked at my uncle and saw that his face was white.
His fingers were twisting back and forth and he seemed
not to know what to say; but at last he nodded and said,
"All right, Neil," and got down from the wagon; and we
all climbed out and stretched our stiff muscles.</p>

<p>"Here's a boat handy," Gleazen cried.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth cut the painter, and drawing her up to a
convenient ladder, we began to carry down our various
belongings, finishing with the big bags that hours before
I had packed so carefully in the bottom of the wagon.
Neil Gleazen then seated himself in the stern sheets, Abe
Guptil took the oars, and I climbed into the bow.</p>

<p>As Uncle Seth was coming on board, Sim Muzzy stopped
him.</p>

<p>"What about the horses?" he exclaimed. "You ain't
going off to leave them, are you? Not with wagon and all.
Why, they must be worth a deal of money; they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come, you prattling fool," Gleazen called.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, after reflecting a moment, added sharply,
"They'll maybe go to pay for the boat we're taking. I
don't like to steal, but now I see no way out. Quick! I
hear steps."</p>

<p>So down came Sim, and out into the harbor we rowed;
and when I turned to look, I saw close at hand for the first
time the brig Adventure.</p>

<p>She was a trim, well-proportioned craft, with a grace of
masts and spars and a neatness of rigging and black and
white paint that quite captivated me, although coming
from what was virtually an inland town, I was by no
means qualified to pass judgment on her merits; and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
not too weary to be glad to know that she, of all vessels in
the harbor, was the one in which we were to sail.</p>

<p>When a sleepy sailor on deck called, "Boat ahoy!"
Gleazen gave him better than he sent with a loud, "Ahoy,
Adventure!"</p>

<p>Then we came up to her and swung with the tide under
her chains, until a couple of other sailors came running to
help us get our goods aboard; then up we scrambled, one
at a time, and set the boat adrift.</p>

<p>I now found myself on a neat clean deck, and was taken
with the buckets and pins and coiled ropes lying in tidy
fakes&mdash;but I should say, too, that I was so tired after my
long night ride that I could scarcely keep my eyes open,
so that I paid little attention to what was going on
around me until I heard Uncle Seth saying, "And this,
Captain North, is my nephew. If there are quarters for
him aft, I'll be glad, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir, of course," the captain replied; and I
knew when I first heard his voice that I was going to like
him. "If he and the Frenchman&mdash;Lamont you say's his
name?&mdash;can share a stateroom, I've one with two berths.
Good! And you say we must sail at once? Hm! In half
an hour wind and tide will be in our favor. We're light of
ballast, but if we're careful, I've no doubt it will be safe.
We must get some fresh water. But that we can hurry up.
Hm! I hadn't expected sailing orders so soon; but in an
hour's time, Mr. Upham, if it's necessary, I can weigh
anchor."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Uncle Seth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Severance," Captain North called, "take five men
and the cutter for the rest of the fresh water, and be quick
about it. Willie, take Mr. Woods and Mr. Lamont below
and show them to the stateroom the lady passengers had
when we came up from Rio. Now then, Guptil, you take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
your bag forward and stow it in the forecastle, and if
you're hungry, tell the cook I said to give you a good cup
of coffee and a plate of beans."</p>

<p>As with Arnold Lamont I followed Willie MacDougald,
the little cabin boy, I was too tired to care a straw about
life on board a ship; and before I should come on deck
again, I was to be too sick. But as I threw myself into one
of the berths in our tiny cubby, I welcomed the prospect
of at least a long sleep, and I told Arnold how sincerely
glad I was that we were to be together.</p>

<p>"Joe," he said, slowly and precisely, "I am very much
afraid that we are going on a wild-goose chase. Seth
Upham has been kind to me in his own way. He is one of
the few friends I have in this world. Now, I think, he
would gladly be rid of me. But I shall stay with him to
the end, for I think the time is coming when he will need
his friends."</p>

<p>I am afraid I fell asleep before Arnold finished what he
had to say; but weary though I was, I felt even then a
great confidence in this quiet, restrained man. He was so
wise, so unfathomable. And I felt already the growing determination,
which, before we had seen the last of Neil
Gleazen, was to absorb almost my very life, to work side
by side with Arnold Lamont in order to save what we
could of Uncle Seth's happiness and property from the
hands of the man who, we both saw, had got my poor
uncle completely in his power.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="small">AN OLD SEA SONG</span></h3>

<p>The noise of the crew as they catted the anchor and
made sail must have waked me more than once, for to
this very day I remember hearing distinctly the loud
chorus of a chantey, the trampling of many feet, the
creaking and rattling and calling&mdash;the strange jumble of
sounds heard only when a vessel is getting under way.
But strange and interesting though it all was, I must immediately
have fallen asleep again each time, for the memories
come back to me like strange snatches of a vivid
dream, broken and disconnected, for all that they are so
clear.</p>

<p>When at last, having slept my sleep out, I woke with
no inclination to close my eyes again, and sat up in my
berth, the brig was pitching and rolling in a heavy sea, and
a great wave of sickness engulfed me, such as I had never
experienced. How long it lasted, I do not know, but at the
time it seemed like months and years.</p>

<p>Perhaps, had I been forced to go on deck and work
aloft, and eat coarse sea-food, and meet my sickness like a
man, I might have thrown it off in short order and have
got my sea-legs as soon as another. But coming on board
as the owner's nephew, with a stateroom at my command,
I lay and suffered untold wretchedness, now thinking that
I was getting better, now relapsing into agonies that
seemed to me ten times worse than before. Uncle Seth
himself, I believe, was almost as badly off, and Arnold
Lamont and Willie MacDougald had a time of it tending
us. Even Arnold suffered a touch of sickness at first; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
recovering from it promptly, he took Uncle Seth and me
in his charge and set Willie jumping to attend our wants,
which he did with a comical alacrity that under other circumstances
would mightily have amused me.</p>

<p>I took what satisfaction I could in being able to come
on deck two days before Uncle Seth would stir from his
bunk; but even then I was good for nothing except to lie
on a blanket that Arnold and Willie spread for me, or to
lean weakly against the rail.</p>

<p>But now, as I watched the blue seas through which the
keen bow of the brig, a Baltimore craft of clipper lines,
swiftly and smoothly cut its course, the great white sails,
with every seam drawn to a taut, clean curve by the wind,
the occasional glimpses of low land to the west, and the
succession of great clouds that swept across the blue sky
like rolling masses of molten silver, I fell to thinking in a
dull, bewildered way of all that we had left behind.</p>

<p>How long would it be, I wondered, before someone
would take charge of the horses we had left on the wharf
in Boston? I could imagine the advertisement that would
appear in the paper, and the questions of the people, until
news should come from Topham of all that had happened.
Who then, I wondered, would get the team?</p>

<p>Well, all that was done with, and we were embarked on
our great adventure. What was to become of us, no human
prophet could foretell.</p>

<p>Cornelius Gleazen, who years before had got over his
last attack of seasickness, welcomed me on deck, with
rough good-nature; but something in his manner told me
that, from this time on, in his eyes I was one of the crowd,
no further from his favor, perhaps, than any of the others,
but certainly no nearer it.</p>

<p>To me, so weak from my long sickness that I could
scarcely stand unaided, this came like a blow, even although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
I had completely lost my admiration for the man.
I had been so sure of his friendly interest! So confident
of my own superiority! As I thought of it, I slowly came
to see that his kindness and flattery had been but a part
of his deep and well-considered plan to work into the confidence
of my uncle; that since he had secured his hold
upon Seth Upham and all his worldly goods, I, vain,
credulous youth, might, for all he cared, sink or swim.</p>

<p>"Well," he would say carelessly, "how's the lad this
morning?" And when I would reply from the depths of
my misery, he would respond briefly, as he strolled away,
"Better pull yourself together. There's work ahead for all
hands."</p>

<p>It was not in his words, you understand, that I found
indication of his changed attitude,&mdash;he was always a man
of careless speech,&mdash;but in his manner of saying them.
The tilt of his head, and his trick of not looking at me
when he spoke and when I replied, told me as plainly as
direct speech could have done that, having gained whatever
ends he had sought by flattery, he cared not a straw
whether I came with him or followed my own inclinations
to the opposite end of the earth.</p>

<p>So we sailed, south, until we entered the Straits of Florida.
Now we saw at a distance great scarlet birds flying
in a row. Now schools of porpoises played around us.
Now a big crane, speckled brown and white, alighted on
our rigging. Now we passed green islands, now sandy
shoals where the sea rose into great waves and crashed
down in cauldrons of foam. And now we sighted land and
learned that it was Cuba.</p>

<p>All this time I had constantly been gaining strength, and
though more than once we had passed through spells of
rough weather, I had had no return of seasickness. It was
natural, therefore, that I should take an increasing interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in all that went on around me. With some of the sailors
I established myself on friendly terms, although others
seemed to suspect me of attempting to patronize them;
and thanks to the tutelage of Captain North, I made myself
familiar with the duties of the crew and with the more
common evolutions of a sailing ship. But in all that voyage
only one thing came to my notice that gave any
suggestion of what was before us, and that suggestion was
so vague that at the time I did not suspect how significant
it was.</p>

<p>In the first dog watch one afternoon, the carpenter, who
had a good voice and a good ear for music, got out his
guitar and, after strumming a few chords, began to sing a
song so odd that I set my mind on remembering it, and
later wrote the words down:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Old King Mungo-Hungo-Ding</div>
<div class="line i2">A barracoon he made,</div>
<div class="line">And sold his blessed subjects to</div>
<div class="line i2">A captain in the trade.</div>
<div class="line">And when his subjects all were gone,</div>
<div class="line i2">Oh, what did Mungo do?</div>
<div class="line">He drove his wives and daughters in</div>
<div class="line i2">And traded for them, too."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He sang it to a queer tune that caught my feet and set
them twitching, and it was no surprise to see three or four
sailors begin to shuffle about the deck in time to the music.</p>

<p>As the carpenter took up the chorus, they, too, began to
sing softly and to dance a kind of a hornpipe; but, I must
confess, I was surprised to hear someone behind me join
in the singing under his breath. The last time when I had
heard that voice singing was in the village church in Topham,
and unless my memory serves me wrong, it then had
sung that good hymn:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"No, I shall envy them no more, who grow profanely great;</div>
<div class="line">Though they increase their golden store, and shine in robes of state."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was Cornelius Gleazen, who, it appeared, knew both
words and tune of the carpenter's song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Tally on the braces! Heave and haul in time!</div>
<div class="line">Four and twenty niggers and all of them was prime!</div>
<div class="line">Old King Mungo's daughters, they bought our lasses rings.</div>
<div class="line">Heave now! Pull now! They never married kings."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They sang on and on to the strumming of the guitar,
while all the rest stood around and watched them; and
when they had finished the song, which told how King
Mungo, when he had sold his family as well as his subjects,
made a raid upon his neighbors and was captured in
his turn and, very justly, was himself sold as a slave,
Cornelius Gleazen cried loudly, "<i>Encore! Encore!</i>" and
clapped his hands, until the carpenter, with a droll look
in his direction, again began to strum his guitar and sang
the song all over.</p>

<p>As I have said, at the time I attributed little significance
to Cornelius Gleazen's enthusiasm for the song or to the
look that the carpenter gave him. But when I saw Captain
North staring from one to the other and realized that
he had seen and heard only what I had, I wondered why
he wore so queer an expression, and why, for some time to
come, he was so grave and stiff in his dealings with both
Gleazen and Uncle Seth. Nor did it further enlighten me
to see that Arnold Lamont and Captain North exchanged
significant glances.</p>

<p>So at last we came to the mouth of Havana harbor, and
you can be sure that when, after lying off the castle all
night, we set our Jack at the main as signal for a pilot, and
passed through the narrow strait between Moro Castle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the great battery of La Punta, and came to anchor in the
vast and beautiful port where a thousand ships of war
might have lain, I was all eyes for my first near view of a
foreign city.</p>

<p>On every side were small boats plying back and forth,
some laden with freight of every description, from fresh
fruit to nondescript, dingy bales, others carrying only one
or two passengers or a single oarsman. There were scores
of ships, some full of stir and activity getting up anchor
and making sail, others seeming half asleep as they lay
with only a drowsy anchor watch. On shore, besides the
grand buildings and green avenues and long fortifications,
I could catch here and there glimpses of curious two-wheeled
vehicles, of men and women with bundles on their
heads, of countless negroes lolling about on one errand or
another, and, here and there, of men on horseback. I
longed to hurry ashore, and when I saw Uncle Seth and
Neil Gleazen deep in conversation, I had great hopes that
I should accomplish my desire. But something at that moment
put an end for the time being to all such thoughts.</p>

<p>Among the boats that were plying back and forth I saw
one that attracted my attention by her peculiar man&oelig;uvres.
A negro was rowing her at the command of a
big dark man, who leaned back in the stern and looked
sharply about from one side to the other. Now he had
gone beyond us, but instead of continuing, he came about
and drew nearer.</p>

<p>He wore his hair in a pig-tail, an old fashion that not
many men continued to observe, and on several fingers he
wore broad gold rings. His face was seamed and scarred.
There were deep cuts on cheek and chin, which might have
been either scars or natural wrinkles, and across his forehead
and down one cheek were two white lines that must
have been torn in the first place by some weapon or missile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
His hands were big and broad and powerful, and
there was a grimly determined air in the set of his head
and the thin line of his mouth that made me think of him
as a man I should not like to meet alone in the dark.</p>

<p>From the top of his round head to the soles of his feet,
his whole body gave an impression of great physical
strength. His jaws and chin were square and massive; his
bull neck sloped down to great broad shoulders, and his
deep chest made his long, heavy arms seem to hang away
from his body. As he lay there in the stern of the boat,
with every muscle relaxed, yet with great swelling masses
standing out under his skin all over him, I thought to
myself that never in all my life had I seen so powerful
a man.</p>

<p>Now he leaned forward and murmured something to the
negro, who with a stroke of his oars deftly brought the
boat under the stern of the Adventure and held her there.
Then the man, smiling slightly, amazed me by calling in
a voice so soft and gentle and low that it seemed almost
effeminate: "Neil Gleazen! Neil Gleazen!"</p>

<p>The effect on Cornelius Gleazen was startling almost
beyond words. Springing up and staring from one side to
the other as if he could not believe his ears, he roared
furiously: "By the Holy! Molly Matterson, where are
you?"</p>

<p>Then the huge bull of a man, speaking in that same low,
gentle voice, said; "So you know me, Neil?"</p>

<p>"Know you? I'd know your voice from Pongo River to
Penzance," Gleazen replied, whirling about and leaning far
over the taffrail.</p>

<p>The big man laughed so lightly that his voice seemed almost
to tinkle. "You're eager, Neil," he said. Then he
glanced at me and spoke again in a language that I could
not understand.  At the time I had no idea what it was, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
since then I have come to know well&mdash;too well&mdash;that it
was Spanish.</p>

<p>And all the time my uncle stood by with a curiously
wistful expression. It was as if he felt himself barred from
their council; as if he longed to be one of them, hand in
glove, and yet felt that there was between him and them a
gap that he could not quite bridge; as if with his whole
heart he had given himself and everything that was his, as
indeed he had, only to receive a cold welcome. Remembering
how haughtily Uncle Seth himself had but a little
while ago regarded the good people of Topham, how seldom
he had expressed even the very deep affection in
which he held me, his only sister's only son, I marveled at
the simple, frank eagerness with which he now watched
those two; and since anyone could see that of him they
were thinking lightly, if at all, I felt for him a pang of
sympathy.</p>

<p>For a while the two talked together. Now they glanced
at me, now at the others. I am confident that they told no
secrets, for of course there was always the chance that
some of us might speak the tongue, too. But that they
talked more freely than they would have talked in English,
I was very confident.</p>

<p>At last Gleazen said, "Come aboard at all events."</p>

<p>Instead of going around to the chains, the big man
whom Gleazen had hailed as Molly Matterson stood up
in the boat, crouched slightly, and leaping straight into the
air, caught the taffrail with one hand. Gracefully, easily,
he lifted himself by that one hand to the rail, placed his
other hand upon it, where his gold rings gleamed dully, and
lightly vaulted to the deck.</p>

<p>I now saw better what a huge man he was, for he towered
above us all, even Neil Gleazen, and he seemed
almost as broad across the chest as any two of us.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>He gently shook hands with Uncle Seth and Captain
North, to whom Gleazen introduced him, again glanced
curiously at the rest of us, and then stepped apart with
Gleazen and Uncle Seth. I could hear only a little of what
they said, and the little that I did hear was concerned
with unfamiliar names and mysterious things.</p>

<p>I saw Arnold Lamont watching them, too, and remembering
how they had talked in a strange language, I wished
that Arnold might have appeared to know what they had
been saying. Well as I thought I knew Arnold, it never occurred
to me that he might have known and, for reasons
of his own, have held his tongue.</p>

<p>Of one thing I was convinced, however; the strange talk
that was now going on was no such puzzle to Captain
Gideon North as to me. The more he listened, the more
his lips twitched and the more his frown deepened. It was
queer, I thought, that he should appear to be so quick-tempered
as to show impatience because he was not taken
into their counsel. He had seemed so honest and fair-minded
and generous that I had not suspected him of any
such pettiness.</p>

<p>Presently Gleazen turned about and said loudly, "Captain
North, we are going below to have a glass of wine together.
Will you come?"</p>

<p>The captain hesitated, frowned, and then, as if he had
suddenly made up his mind that he might as well have
things over soon as late, stalked toward the companionway.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes afterward, to the amazement of every
man on deck, he came stamping up again, red with anger,
followed by Willie MacDougald, who was staggering under
the weight of his bag. Ordering a boat launched, he turned
to Uncle Seth, who had followed him and stood behind
him with a blank, dismayed look.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Upham," he said, "I am sorry to leave your vessel
like this, but I will not, sir, I will not remain in command
of any craft afloat, be she coasting brig or ship-of-the-line,
where the owner's friends are suffered to treat me
thus. Willie, drop my bag into the boat."</p>

<p>And with that, red-faced and breathing hard, he left the
Adventure and gave angry orders to the men in the boat,
who rowed him ashore. But it was not the last that we
were to see of Gideon North.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">MATTERSON</span></h3>

<p>"And who," I wondered, as I turned from watching
Gideon North go out of sight between the buildings that
lined the harbor side, "who will now command the Adventure?"</p>

<p>You would have expected the captain's departure to
make a great stir in a vessel; yet scarcely a person forward
knew what was going on, and aft only Seth Upham and
Willie MacDougald, besides myself, were seeing him off.
Uncle Seth still stood in the companionway with that
blank, dazed expression; but Willie MacDougald scratched
his head and looked now at me and now at Uncle Seth, as
if whatever had happened below had frightened him mightily.
The picture of their bewilderment was so funny that
I could have burst out laughing; and yet, so obviously
was there much behind it which did not appear on the surface,
that I was really more apprehensive than amused.</p>

<p>When Uncle Seth suddenly turned and disappeared
down the companionway, and when Willie MacDougald
with an inquisitive glance at me darted over to the companion-hatch
and stood there with his head cocked bird-like
on one side to catch any sound that might issue from
the cabin, I boldly followed my uncle.</p>

<p>The brig was riding almost without motion at her anchorage,
and all on deck was so quiet that we could hear
across the silent harbor the rattle of blocks in a distant
ship, the voice of a bos'n driving his men to greater effort,
and from the distant city innumerable street cries.
In the cabin, too, as I descended to it, everything was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
still. When I came to the door, I saw my uncle standing at
one side of the big, round table on which a chart lay. Opposite
him sat Neil Gleazen, and on his right that huge man
with the light voice, Molly Matterson.</p>

<p>None of them so much as glanced at me when I appeared
in the door; but I saw at once that, although they
were saying nothing, they were thinking deeply and angrily.
The intensity with which they glared, the two now
staring hard at Seth Upham and now at each other, my
uncle looking first at Matterson, then at Gleazen, and
then at Matterson again, so completely absorbed my interest,
that I think nothing short of a broadside fired by a
man-of-war could have distracted my attention.</p>

<p>I heard the steps creak as Willie MacDougald now came
on tiptoe part way down the companion. I heard the heavy
breathing of the men in the cabin. Then, far across the
harbor, I heard the great voice of a chantey man singing
while the crew heaved at the windlass. And still the three
men glared in silence at one another. It was Matterson
who broke the spell, when in his almost girlish voice he
said; "He don't seem to like me as captain of his vessel,
Neil."</p>

<p>"You old whited sepulchre," Neil Gleazen cried, speaking
not to Matterson, but to my uncle; "just because
you've got money at stake is no reason to think you know
a sailor-man when you see one. Why, Matterson, here,
could give Gideon North a king's cruiser and outsail him
in a Gloucester pinkie."</p>

<p>My uncle swallowed hard and laughed a little wildly.
"If you hadn't got yourself run out of town, Neil Gleazen,
and had to leave your chests with all that's in them behind
you, you might have had money to put in this vessel
yourself. As it is, the brig's mine and I swear I'll have
a voice in saying who's to be her master."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"A voice you shall have," Gleazen retorted, while the
bull-necked Matterson broadly grinned at the squabble;
"a voice you shall have, but you're only one of five good
men, Seth, only one, and a good long way from being the
best of 'em, and your voice is just one vote in five. Now
I, here, vote for Molly and, Molly, here, votes for himself,
and there ain't no need of thinking who the others
would vote for. We've outvoted you already."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth turned from red to white and from white to
red. "Let it be one vote to four, then. Though it's only
one to four, my vote is better than all the rest. The brig's
mine. I swear, if you try to override me so, I'll put her in
the hands of the law. And if these cursed Spaniards will
not do me justice,&mdash;" again he laughed a little wildly,&mdash;"there's
an American frigate in port and we'll see what
her officers will say."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Gleazen, gently, "we'll see what we shall
see. But you mark what I'm going to tell you, Seth
Upham, mark it and mull it over: I'm a ruined man;
there's a price on <i>my</i> head, I know. But they'll never take
me, because I've friends ashore,&mdash;eh, Molly? You can
do <i>me</i> no harm by going to the captain of any frigate you
please. <i>But</i>&mdash;<i>But</i>&mdash;let me tell you this, Seth Upham:
when you've called in help and got this brig away from
your friends what have given you a chance to better yourself,
news is going to come to the captain of that ship
about all them churches you and me used to rob together
when we was lads in Topham. Aye, Seth, and about one
thing and another that will interest the captain. And supposing
he don't clap you into irons and leave you there
to cool your heels,&mdash;supposing he don't, mind you,&mdash;which
he probably will, to get the reward that folks will
be offering when I've told what I shall tell,&mdash;supposing
you come back to Topham from which you run away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
that desperate villain, Neil Gleazen,&mdash;supposing, which
ain't likely, that's what happens, you'll find when you
get there that news has come before you. You old fool,
unless you and me holds together like the old friends which
we used to be, you'll find yourself a broken man with the
jail doors open and waiting for you. I know what I know,
and you know what I know, but as long as I keep my
mouth shut nobody else is going to know. <i>As long as I
keep my mouth shut, mind you.</i></p>

<p>"Now I votes for Molly Matterson as captain; and let
me tell you, Seth Upham, you'd better be reasonable and
come along like you and me owned this brig together,
which by rights we do, seeing that I've put in the brains
as my share. It ain't fitting to talk of <i>your</i> owning her
outright."</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, I could see, was baffled and bewildered and
hurt. With an irresolute glance at me, which seemed to
express his confusion plainer than words, he nervously
twitched his fingers and at last in a low, hurried voice
said: "That's all talk, and talk's cheap&mdash;unless it's
money talking. Now if you hadn't made a fool of yourself
and had to run away and leave your chests and money
behind you, you'd have a right to talk."</p>

<p>Gleazen suddenly threw back his head and roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>"Them chests!" he bellowed. "Oh, them chests!"</p>

<p>"Well," Uncle Seth cried, wrinkling his face till his nose
seemed to be the centre of a spider's web, "well, why not?
What's so cursedly funny about them chests?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho ho!" Gleazen roared. "Them chests! Money!
There warn't no money in them chests&mdash;not a red round
copper."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;but why&mdash;" Uncle Seth's face, always
quick to express every emotion, smoothed out until it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
as blank with amazement as before it had been wrinkled
with petulance.</p>

<p>"You silly fool," Gleazen thundered,&mdash;no other word
can express the vigor of contempt and derision that his
voice conveyed,&mdash;"do you think that, if ever I had got a
comfortable fortune safe to Topham, I'd take to the sea
and leave it there? Bah! Them chests was crammed to
the lid with toys and trinkets, which I've long since given
to the children. Them chests served their purpose well,
Seth,&mdash;" again he laughed, and we knew that he was
laughing at my uncle and me, who had believed all his
great tales of vast wealth,&mdash;"and they'll do me one
more good turn when they show their empty sides to
whomsoever pulls 'em open in hope of finding gold."</p>

<p>Matterson, looking from one to another, laughed with a
ladylike tinkle of his light voice, and Gleazen once more
guffawed; but my uncle sat weakly down and turned
toward me his dazed face.</p>

<p>He and I suddenly, for the first time, realized to the full
what we should of course have been stupid indeed not to
have got inklings of before: that Neil Gleazen had come
home to Topham, an all but penniless adventurer; that,
instead of being a rich man who wished to help my uncle
and the rest of us to better ourselves, he had been working
on credulous Uncle Seth's cupidity to get from him the
wherewithal to restablish his own shattered fortunes.</p>

<p>Of the pair of us, I was the less amazed. Although I had
by no means guessed all that Gleazen now revealed, I had
nevertheless been more suspicious than my uncle of the
true state of the chests that Gleazen had so willingly
abandoned at the inn.</p>

<p>"Come," said Matterson, lightly, "let's be friends,
Upham. I'm no ogre. I can sail your vessel. You'll see
the crew work as not many crews know how to work&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
yet I'll not drive 'em hard, either. I make one flogging
go a long way, Upham. Here's my hand on it. Nor
do I want to be greedy. Say the word and I'll be mate, not
skipper. Find your own skipper."</p>

<p>My uncle looked from one to the other. He was still
dazed and disconcerted. We lacked a mate because circumstances
had forced us to sail at little more than a moment's
notice, with only Mr. Severance as second officer.
It was manifest that the two regarded my uncle with good-humored
contempt, that he was not in the least necessary
to their plans, yet that with something of the same clumsy
tolerance with which a great, confident dog regards an
annoying terrier, they were entirely willing to forgive his
petulant outbursts, provided always that he did not too
long persist in them. What could the poor man do? He
accepted Matterson's proffered hand, failed to restrain a
cry when the mighty fist squeezed his fingers until the
bones crackled, and weakly settled back in his chair, while
Gleazen again laughed.</p>

<p>When he and Gleazen faced about with hostile glances,
I turned away, carrying with me the knowledge that Matterson
was to go to Africa with the Adventure in one capacity,
if not in another, and left the three in the cabin.</p>

<p>In the companionway I all but stumbled over Willie
MacDougald, who was such a comical little fellow, with
his great round eyes and freckled face and big ears, which
stood out from his head like a pair of fans, that I was
amused by what I assumed to be merely his lively curiosity.
But late that same night I found occasion to suspect
that it was more than mere curiosity, and of that I
shall presently speak again.</p>

<p>There were, it seemed to me, when I came up on the
quarter-deck of the Adventure, a thousand strange sights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to be seen, and in my eager desire to miss none of them
I almost, <i>but never quite</i>, forgot what had been going on
below.</p>

<p>When at last Seth Upham emerged alone from the companion
head, he came and stood beside me without a
word, and, like me, fell to watching the flags of many nations
that were flying in the harbor, the city on its flat,
low plain, the softly green hills opposite us, and the great
fortifications that from the entrance to the harbor and
from the distant hilltops guarded town and port. After a
while, he began to pace back and forth across the quarter-deck.
His head was bent forward as he walked and there
was an unhappy look in his eyes.</p>

<p>I could see that various of the men were watching him;
but he gave no sign of knowing it, and I truly think he was
entirely unconscious of what went on around him. Back
and forth he paced, and back and forth, buried always
deep in thought; and though several times I became aware
that he had fixed his eyes upon me, never was I able to
look up quickly enough to meet them squarely, nor had he
a word to say to me. Poor Uncle Seth! Had one who
thought himself so shrewd really fallen such an easy victim
to a man whose character he ought by rights to have
known in every phase and trait? I left him still pacing the
deck when I went below to supper.</p>

<p>Because of my long seasickness I had had comparatively
few meals in the cabin, and always before there had been
the honest face of Gideon North to serve me as a sea
anchor, so to speak; but now even Uncle Seth was absent,
and as Arnold Lamont and I sat opposite Matterson and
Gleazen, with Uncle Seth's place standing empty at one
end of the table and the captain's place standing empty
at the other, I could think only of Gideon North going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
angrily over the side, and of Uncle Seth pacing ceaselessly
back and forth.</p>

<p>Willie MacDougald slipped from place to place, laying
and removing dishes. Now he was replenishing the glasses,&mdash;Gleazen's
with port from a cut-glass decanter, Matterson's
with gin from a queer old blown-glass bottle with a
tiny mouth,&mdash;now he was scurrying forward, pursued by
a volley of oaths, to get a new pepper for the grinder.
Gleazen, always an able man at his food, said little and
ate much; but Matterson showed us that he could both
eat and talk, for he consumed vast quantities of bread and
meat, and all the while he discoursed so interestingly on
one thing and another that, in spite of myself, I came
fairly to hang upon his words.</p>

<p>As in his incongruously effeminate voice he talked of
men in foreign ports, and strangely rigged ships, and all
manner of hairbreadth escapes, and described desperate
fights that had occurred, he said, not a hundred miles
from where at that moment we sat, I could fairly see the
things he spoke of and hear the guns boom. He thrilled
me by tales of wild adventure on the African coast and
both fascinated and horrified me by stories of "the trade,"
as he called it.</p>

<p>"Ah," he would say, so lightly that it was hard to believe
that the words actually came from that great bulk of
a man, "I have seen them marching the niggers down to
the sea, single file through the jungle, chained one to another.
Men, women and children, all marching along down
to the barracoons, there's a sight for you! Chained hand
and foot they are, too, and horribly afraid until they're
stuffed with rice and meat, and see that naught but good's
intended. They're cheery, then, aye, cheery's the word."</p>

<p>"Hm!" Gleazen grunted.</p>

<p>"Aye, it's a grand sight to see 'em clap their hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and sing and gobble down the good stews and the rice.
They're better off than ever they were before, and it don't
take 'em long to learn that."</p>

<p>Matterson cast a sidelong glance at me as he leaned
back and sipped his gin, and Gleazen grunted again.
Gleazen, too, I perceived, was singularly interested in seeing
how I took their talk.</p>

<p>What they were really driving at, I had no clear idea;
but I soon saw that Arnold Lamont, more keenly than I,
had detected the purpose of Matterson's stories.</p>

<p>"That," said he, slowly and precisely, "is very interesting.
Has Mr. Gleazen likewise engaged in the slave
trade?"</p>

<p>There was something in his voice that caused the two of
them to exchange quick glances.</p>

<p>Gleazen looked hard at his wine glass and made no answer;
but Matterson, with a genial smile, replied: "Oh, I
said nothing of engaging in the slave trade. I was just telling
of sights I've seen in Africa, and I've no doubt at all
that Mr. Gleazen has seen the same sights, and merrier
ones."</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful thing," Arnold went on, in a grave
voice, "to travel and see the world and know strange
peoples. I have often wished that I could do so. Now I
think that my wish is to be gratified."</p>

<p>As before, there was something strangely suggestive in
his voice. I puzzled over it and made nothing of it, yet I
could no more ignore it than could Matterson and Gleazen,
who again exchanged glances.</p>

<p>When Matterson muttered a word or two in Spanish and
Gleazen replied in the same language, I looked hard at
Arnold to see if he understood.</p>

<p>His expression gave no indication that he did, but I
could not forget the words he had used long ago in Topham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
before ever I had suspected Neil Gleazen of being a
whit other than he seemed. "A man," Arnold had said,
"does not tell all he knows." There was no doubt in my
mind that Arnold was a <i>man</i> in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>Again Gleazen and Matterson spoke in Spanish; then
Matterson with a warm smile turned to us and said,
"Will you have a glass of wine, lads? You, Arnold? No?
And you, Joe? No?" He raised his eyebrows and with a
deprecatory gesture glanced once more at Gleazen.</p>

<p>I thought of Uncle Seth still pacing the quarter-deck.
I suddenly realized that I was afraid of the two men who
sat opposite me&mdash;afraid to drink with them or even to
continue to talk with them. My fear passed as a mood
changes; but in its place came the determination that I
would not drink with them or talk with them. They were
no friends of mine. I pushed back my chair, and, leaving
Arnold below, went on deck.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="small">NEW LIGHT ON AN OLD FRIEND</span></h3>

<p>My uncle was still pacing back and forth when I came
out into the sunset; then, almost at once, the twilight had
come and gone, and I saw him as a deeper shadow moving
up and down the deck, with only the faint sound of
his feet to convince me that my eyes saw truly. The
very monotony of his slow, even steps told me that
there was no companionship to be got from him, and at
that moment more than anything else I desired companionship.</p>

<p>What I then did was for me a new step. Leaving the
quarter-deck, I went forward to the steerage and found
Sim Muzzy smoking his pipe with the sailmaker.</p>

<p>"So it's you," he querulously said, when he recognized
me, "Now aren't you sorry you ever left Topham? If I
had lost as much as you have by Seth Upham's going into
his second childhood, I vow I'd jump overboard and be
done with life. You're slow enough to look up your old
friends, seems to me."</p>

<p>"But," said I, impatiently, "I've been like to die of
seasickness. I couldn't look you up then, and you never
came near me."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all very well for you to say, but you know
I couldn't come aft without a trouncing from that Neil
Gleazen&mdash;I'm sure I'd like to see something awful happen
to him to pay him for breaking up the store!&mdash;and
you've had plenty of time since. If I didn't show more
fondness for my friends than you do, I'd at least have the
good grace to stay away from them. You've used me very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
shabbily indeed, Joe Woods, and I've got the spirit to
resent it."</p>

<p>The sailmaker, meanwhile, as if he were not listening
with vast interest to all that Sim had to say against me,
looked absently away and quietly smoked his pipe. But
I imagined that I detected in his eyes a glint of amusement
at what he assumed to be my discomfiture, and angered
as much by that as by Sim's petulance, I turned my
back on the two and went on forward to the forecastle,
where I found Abraham Guptil, sprawled full length, in
quiet conversation with two shipmates.</p>

<p>From Abe I got pleasanter greetings.</p>

<p>"Here's Joe Woods," he cried, "one of the best friends
Abe Guptil ever had. You had a hard voyage, didn't you,
Joe? I was sorry to hear you were so bad off, I'd hoped to
see more of you."</p>

<p>I threw myself down beside Abe and fell to talking with
him and the others about affairs aft and forward, such as
Captain North and his quarrel with Seth Upham, and the
meeting of Gleazen and Matterson, and Sim Muzzy and
his irritating garrulousness, and a score of things that had
happened among the crew. It was all so very friendly and
pleasant, that I was sorry to leave them and go back to my
stateroom, and I did so only when I was like to have
fallen asleep in spite of myself. But on the quarter-deck,
when I passed, I saw Seth Upham still pacing back and
forth. He must have known that it was I, for I came close
to him and spoke his name, yet he completely ignored my
presence.</p>

<p>How long he kept it up, I do not know; looking over my
shoulder, I saw last, as I went down the companionway,
his stooped figure and bowed head moving like a shadow
back and forth, and back and forth. Nor do I know just
when my drowsy thoughts merged into dreams; but it
seems to me, as I look back upon that night, that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
uncle's bent figure silently pacing the deck haunted me
until dawn. Only when some noise waked me at daybreak,
and I crept up the companionway and found that
he was no longer there, did I succeed in escaping from the
spell.</p>

<p>Returning to our stateroom to dress, I came upon
Arnold Lamont lying wide awake.</p>

<p>"Joe," said he, when I was pulling on my clothes, "I am
surprised to hear that Seth Upham ever believed Neil
Gleazen to be aught but penniless."</p>

<p>I turned and looked at him. How could Arnold have
learned of the quarrel between Uncle Seth and Gleazen
and Matterson, which only I had witnessed? Or, if he had
not learned of the quarrel and what transpired in the course
of it, where had he heard the story of Gleazen's empty
chests?</p>

<p>Perceiving my amazement, he smiled. "I know many
things that happen on board this vessel, Joe," he said.</p>

<p>"How much," I demanded, "do you know about what
happened yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Everything," said he.</p>

<p>"But how?" I cried. I was at my wit's end with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>I heard a quick step.</p>

<p>"Joe," he whispered, "you must never tell. Crawl under
your blankets and cover your head so no one can see that
you are there."</p>

<p>More puzzled, even, than before, I complied. Whatever
Arnold had up his sleeve, I was convinced that he
was not merely making game of me; and, in truth, I had
no sooner concealed myself in my tumbled berth, which
was so deep that this was not hard to do, than a gentle
tap sounded on the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," Arnold said in a low voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The door then opened and I heard hesitant steps.</p>

<p>"Well?" Arnold said, when I had heard the latch of the
door click shut again.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said a piping little voice, which I
knew could come from only Willie MacDougald, "if you
please, sir, they were laughing hearty at Mr. Upham most
of the morning."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and they said it was a shame for him to ruin
his complexion by a-walking all night."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and he was asleep all morning&mdash;at least, sir,
he was in his berth, but I heard him groaning, sir."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. They didn't seem to like the way you and
Joe Woods acted about their stories of trading niggers,
and they said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" That Arnold rose suddenly, I knew by the
creaking of his bunk.</p>

<p>"And they said, sir&mdash;" Willie's voice fell as if he were
afraid to go on.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And they said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Come, speak out."</p>

<p>"And they said&mdash;" again Willie hesitated, then he continued
with a rush, but in a mere whisper&mdash;"that they
was going to get rid of you two."</p>

<p>For a long time there was silence, then Arnold asked in
the same low voice, "Have they laid their plans?"</p>

<p>"They was talking of one thing and another, sir, but in
such a way that I couldn't hear."</p>

<p>Again a long silence followed, which Willie MacDougald
broke by saying, "Please, sir, it was to-day you was
to pay me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, yes,"</p>

<p>I heard a clinking sound as if money were changing
hands; then Willie MacDougald said, "Thank you, sir,"
and turned the latch.</p>

<p>As he left the stateroom I could not forbear from sticking
my head out of the blankets to look after him. He
was so small, so young, seemingly so innocent! Yet for all
his innocence and high voice and respectful phrases, he had
revealed a devilish spirit of hard bargaining by the tone
and manner, if not the words, with which he demanded
his pay; and I was confounded when, as I looked after
him, he turned, met my eyes, and instead of being disconcerted,
gave me a bold, impudent grimace.</p>

<p>"He is a little devil," Arnold said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Do you believe what he tells you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he does not dare lie to me."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "what of his story that they intend to
get rid of us?"</p>

<p>Arnold smiled again. "I shall put it to good use."</p>

<p>It was evident enough now where Arnold had learned
of the quarrel; and as I noted anew his level, fearless gaze,
his clear eyes, and his erect, commanding carriage, I again
recalled his words,&mdash;who could forget them?&mdash;"A man
does not tell all he knows." More and more I was coming
to realize how little we of Topham had known the manner
of man that this Frenchman truly was.</p>

<p>It was with a paradoxical sense of security, a new confidence
in my old friend, that I accompanied Arnold to
breakfast in the great cabin, where two vacant places and
three plates still laid showed that Gleazen and Matterson
had long since come and gone, and that Seth Upham was
still keeping aloof in his own quarters. But little Willie
MacDougald, appearing as ever a picture of childish innocence,
assiduously waited on us; and before we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
through, Matterson came below, flung his great body
into a chair and, calling for gin, settled himself for a
friendly chat.</p>

<p>"Yes, lads," he said in his oddly light voice, "I've decided
to cast my lot with you. I'm going to ship as mate.
Not that I feel I ought,&mdash;I really scarce can afford the
time for a voyage now,&mdash;but Neil Gleazen and Seth
Upham wouldn't hear to my not going."</p>

<p>He broadly grinned at me, for he knew well that I had
heard every word that passed between the three the day
before.</p>

<p>"Well, lads," he went on, "it's a great country we're
going to, and there's great adventures ahead. Yes,&mdash;" he
spoke now with a sort of humorous significance, as if he
were playing boldly with an idea and enjoying it simply
because he was confident that we could not detect what
lay behind it,&mdash;"Yes, there's great adventures ahead.
It's queer, but even here in Cuba a young man never
knows what's going to overtake him next. I've seen young
fellows, with their plans all laid, switched sudden to quite
another set of plans that no one, no, sir, not no one ever
thought they'd tumble into. It's mysterious. Yes, sir,
mysterious it is."</p>

<p>That there was a double meaning behind all this talk, I
had no doubt whatever, and it irritated me that he should
tease us as if we were little children; but I could make no
particular sense of what he said, except so far as Willie
MacDougald's tale served to indicate that it was a threat;
and Arnold Lamont, apparently not a whit disturbed, continued
his meal with great composure and, whatever he
may have thought, gave no sign to enlighten me.</p>

<p>We had so little to say to Matterson in reply, that he
soon left us, and for another day we sat idle on deck or
amused ourselves as best we could, The crew had numberless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
duties to perform, such as painting and caulking
and working on the rigging. Arnold Lamont and Sim
Muzzy got out the chessmen and played for hours, while
Matterson watched them with an interest so intent that I
suspected him of being himself a chess-player; and Gleazen
and Uncle Seth intermittently played at cards. So the day
passed, until in the early evening a boat hailed us, and a
sailor came aboard and said that Captain Jones of the
Merry Jack and Eleanor sent his compliments to Mr.
Upham and Mr. Gleazen and would be glad to have all the
gentlemen come visiting and share a bowl of punch, at
making which his steward had an excellent hand.</p>

<p>My uncle seized upon the invitation with alacrity, for it
seemed that he had met Captain Jones in Havana two
days since. He called to Gleazen and Matterson, saying
with something of his old sharp, pompous manner that
they certainly must come, too, and that he was going also
to bring Arnold, Sim, and me, at which, I perceived, the
two exchanged smiles.</p>

<p>Sim came running aft, ready to complain at the slightest
provocation, but too pleased with the prospect of an
outing to burst forth on no grounds at all; Neil Gleazen
and my uncle led the way toward the quarter-boat in
which we were to go; and Arnold followed them.</p>

<p>It did not escape me that both Gleazen and Matterson
had held their tongues since the sailor delivered his
master's invitation, and that, as they passed me, they exchanged
nudges. I was all but tempted into staying on
board the Adventure. As I meditated on Willie MacDougald's
story, and Matterson's allusions,&mdash;how significant
they were, I could not know,&mdash;the silence of the
two alarmed me more than direct threats would have done.
Why should Gleazen and Matterson look at each other and
smile when all the rest&mdash;all, that is, except myself&mdash;were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
going down by the chains ahead of them? Would
they not, unless they had known more than we about this
Captain Jones and his ship, the Merry Jack and Eleanor,
have asked questions, or perhaps even have declined to go?</p>

<p>Whatever my thoughts, I had no chance to express
them; so over the side I went, close after the rest, and
down into the boat where the sailors waited at their oars.
To none of us did it occur that it was in any way contrary
to the usual etiquette to take Sim Muzzy with us. Except
that force of circumstances had placed him in the steerage,
his position aboard the Adventure was the same as Arnold's
and mine, or even Gleazen's, for that matter.</p>

<p>Poor Sim! For once he forgot to complain and came
with us as gayly as the fly that walked into the spider's
parlor. And yet I now hold the opinion,&mdash;I was a long,
long time in coming to it,&mdash;that after all fate was very
kind to Simeon Muzzy.</p>

<p>He settled himself importantly in the boat and began
to talk a blue streak, as the saying is, about one thing and
another, until I would almost have tossed him overboard.
Uncle Seth, too, frowned at him, and the strange sailors
smiled, and Gleazen and Matterson spoke together in
Spanish and laughed as if they shared a lively joke. But
Arnold Lamont leaned back and half closed his eyes and
appeared to hear nothing of what was going on.</p>

<p>All the way to the Merry Jack and Eleanor, which lay
about a quarter of a mile from the Adventure, Gleazen and
Matterson continued at intervals to exchange remarks in
Spanish; and although Uncle Seth and Arnold Lamont
completely ignored them, Sim, who by now had got so
used to foreign tongues that they no longer astonished and
confused him, took it hard that he could make nothing of
what they said and went into a lively tantrum about it,
at which the strange sailors chuckled as they rowed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing under the counter of the vessel, we continued to
the gangway; but just as we came about the stern, Arnold
touched my hand and by a motion so slight as to pass almost
unnoticed drew my attention to a man-of-war that
lay perhaps a cable's length away.</p>

<p>Under cover of the loud exchange of greetings and the
bustle that occurred when the others were going aboard,
he whispered, "We are safe for the time being. See! Yonder
is a frigate. But either you or I must stay on deck, and
if there is aught of an outcry below, he must call for help
in such a way that there shall be no doubt of its coming."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Hush! They are watching us."</p>

<p>As we followed the others, Arnold stopped by the bulwark
and half leaned, half fell, against it.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, gentlemen," he said in that slow, precise
voice, "For the moment I am ill. It is a mere attack of
dizziness, but I dare not go below. I must stay in the open
air. I beg you will pardon me. I intend no rudeness."</p>

<p>His face did look pale in the half-light, and the others,
whatever their suspicions may have been, said nothing to
indicate that they doubted him. When Captain Jones of
the Merry Jack and Eleanor came toward us a second
time and again with oily courtesy asked us all to the
cabin, Gleazen and Matterson made excuses for Arnold,
and the rest of us went down into the gloomy space below
and left him in the gangway whence he could watch the
hills, which were now dark against the evening sky, and
the black masts of the frigate, which stood by like sentries
guarding our lives and fortunes.</p>

<p>There was a fetid, sickening odor about the ship, such as
I had never before experienced, and the cabin reeked of
rum and tobacco. The skipper had the face of a human
brute, and the mate's right hand was twisted all out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
shape, as if some heavy weapon had once smashed the
bones of it. The more I looked about the dark, low cabin,
and the more I saw and heard of the skipper and his mate,
the more I wished I were on deck with Arnold. But the
punch was brewed in a colossal bowl and gave forth a
fragrance of spices, and Sim Muzzy drank with the rest,
and for a while the five of them were as jolly as the name of
the ship would indicate.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="small">CAPTAIN NORTH AGAIN</span></h3>

<p>First there was talk of old times, for it seemed that
Matterson and Gleazen and Captain Jones were friends of
long standing. Then there was talk of strange wars and
battles, particularly of one battle of Insamankow, of
which neither Gleazen nor Matterson had had other news
than that which Captain Jones now gave them, and in
which it seemed that the British had met with great disaster,
although it puzzled me to know wherein such a
battle even remotely concerned any of us. After that there
was talk of various other things&mdash;a murderous plague of
smallpox that years before had swept the African coast, a
war between the Fantis and Ashantis, a cruiser that they,
with oaths and laughter, said had struck her flag in battle
with a slaver, a year's journey with desert caravans that
traded with the Arabs, and last of all, and apparently
most important, curious ways of circumventing the laws
of England and America and of bribing Cuban officers of
low degree and high.</p>

<p>All this, in a stuffy little place where the mingled smells
of rum and spices and tobacco hung heavily on the air as
they grew stale, filled me with disgust and almost with
nausea. Vile oaths slipped out between each two sentences,
if by rare chance they were not woven into the
very warp of the sentences themselves; such stories of barbarous
and unbelievable cruelty were told and retold as I
cannot bear to call to mind, to say nothing of repeating;
and always I was aware of that sickening odor, now strong,
now weak, which I had detected before we went below.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The first sign that the others gave of noticing it was
when Gleazen threw back his head and cried, "Pfaw!
What a stench! The smell is all I have against the trade."</p>

<p>Matterson laughed, and Captain Jones with his grand
manner said, "You have been too long away from it, Mr.
Gleazen."</p>

<p>"Too long? That's as may be. An old horse settles easy
into harness again."</p>

<p>Captain Jones smiled. With apparent irrelevance, but
with a reminiscent air, he said; "Too long or no, it's a
long time since first we met,&mdash;a long, long time, and yet
I remember as yesterday what a night we had of it. It began
when that blasted Frenchman slipped his cables and
sought to beat us up the river. It was you, Gleazen, that
saved us then. When your message came, with what
haste we landed the boats and towed the old brig straight
up stream! Row? We rowed like the devil, and though
our palms peeled, we won the race. It was a good cargo
you had waiting, too. Only seven died in the passage."</p>

<p>In the passage! Already I had suspected, now I knew,
that the ship with her fast lines and cruel officers was none
other than a slaver; that the smell was the stench of a
slave-ship; that in that very cabin men had bartered for
human beings. If I could, I would have turned my back
on them there and then; the repugnance that I had long
felt grew into downright loathing. What would I not have
given to be up and away with Arnold Lamont! But I was
a mere stripling, alone, so far as help was concerned, in a
den of villains crueler than wolves. Though I would
eagerly have left them, I dared not; and almost at once
something happened that in any case would have held me
where I was.</p>

<p>Gleazen leaned across the punch-bowl and said to Captain
Jones; "Who is there in port will make a good captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
for a smart brig with a neat bow, swift to sail and clever
to work?"</p>

<p>Captain Jones ran his fingers through his stiff, shaggy
hair. "Now, let me see," he replied, "there's a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cutting him sharply off, my uncle spoke up, "Gentlemen,
I will choose the master of my own vessel."</p>

<p>I knew by his voice that he, as well as I, was sickened by
the situation in which we found ourselves. Poor Uncle
Seth, I thought, how little did he suspect, when he united
his fortune with the golden dreams of Neil Gleazen, that
he was to travel such a road as this!</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Gleazen. "And who will it be?" An unkind
smile played around his mouth.</p>

<p>"Gideon North, if he will come back to us," said my
uncle.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Matterson, Gleazen, and Captain Jones exclaimed
as if with one breath.</p>

<p>For a minute or so the three sat in silence, looking hard
at the top of the table; then Matterson with a queer twist
of his lips spoke in Spanish. When, after another silence,
the captain of the Merry Jack and Eleanor answered at
length in the same tongue, Matterson responded briefly,
and all three men nodded.</p>

<p>A quality so curiously and subtly dramatic pervaded
the scene that I remember thinking, as I looked about,
what a rare theme it would have made for a painter. I
believe that a skillful artist, if he had studied the faces of
us all as we sat there, could have put our characters on
his canvas so faithfully that he would have been in danger
of paying for his honesty with his life, had Matterson or
the strange captain had a chance at him in the dark. The
very place in which we sat smelled of villainies, and the
rat-like captain of the ship was a fit master of such a den.</p>

<p>Gleazen now turned to my uncle. "Very well," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
with an amused smile, "Joe, here, and Arnold Lamont are
in good odor with him. Suppose, then, that we let them
go ashore and hunt him out and talk matters over. I've
no doubt he'll come back. He went off in a tantrum, as a
man will when he takes pepper up his nose. You must
know where the fellow's staying. You were to send him
the money due him. Captain Jones will lend them one of
his boats for now, and I'll have our boat ready to take
them all off together in, say, three hours' time."</p>

<p>As I have said in an earlier chapter of this narrative, by
inclination I was a dreamer; and yet I must have been
more than a mere dreamer, and worse, not to have scented
by those dark looks and cryptic words some trouble or
other afoot. It was as if for a long time I had seen the
three to be united definitely against us, but as if I now for
the first time perceived what a desperately black and sinful
alliance they made&mdash;it was as if the spectacle struck
me into a daze. When Gleazen finished, the other two
again nodded, and in the very manner of their nods there
was something as cold and deliberate as a snake's eye.
Had I been able to rely upon the impressions of the moment,
I should have said that time stood as still as the sun
upon Gibeon; that for many minutes we stared at one another
in mutual suspicion; that the beating of my heart
had all but ceased. But the impressions of the moment
deceived me.</p>

<p>When Gleazen stopped speaking, he hit with his elbow
the ink-bottle that stood on the table. It tipped on its
side, rolled deliberately across the table, and fell; but before
it struck the floor, Matterson, leaning out with a
swift, dexterous motion, caught it, tried the stopper, and
murmured as if to himself, "There's luck for you! Not a
drop is lost." In the time it had taken that bottle to roll
across the table, and not a second more, I had suffered
that untold suspense.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the spell was shattered, and hearing someone
speaking in an undertone behind me, I turned and caught
Captain Jones in the act of giving instructions <i>in Spanish</i>
to his negro steward.</p>

<p>I was surprised and angry. Though of late I had heard
much Spanish, it seemed to me that to speak it under the
circumstances was so rude as to verge on open affront.
Then Uncle Seth, gulping down his astonishment that
Gleazen should so readily accede to his wishes, spoke up
for himself; and because I was so deeply interested in
whatever he might have to say, I turned my back on the
mungo, ceased to watch Captain Jones, and did not notice
that the steward went immediately on deck. Nor did
I attribute any significance to the sound of oars bumping
against the pins, which I soon afterwards heard. Had not
Arnold Lamont been waiting on deck with his eyes fixed
apparently on the dark outline of the frigate, my stupidity
must have cost us even more than it did.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Uncle Seth. "I will do as you suggest."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Gleazen, thoughtfully, "Sim Muzzy,
here, would like to go."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," cried Sim, "I'm fair dying for a trip on dry
land. Yes, indeed, I'd like to go. I'd like it mightily.
You've always said, Mr. Gleazen, I was too thick to do
harm. Oh, yes indeed!"</p>

<p>Matterson smiled and Captain Jones covered his mouth
with his hand, but Gleazen gravely nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, Sim, go you shall," said he. "There ain't one of
us here but is glad to see an honest man take his fling
ashore, and Havana's a city for you. Such handsome
women as ride about in their carriages! And such sights
as you'll see in the streets! You'll be a wiser man e'er you
come back to us, Sim. I swear, I'd like to go myself,&mdash;but
not to-night! I ain't one to neglect business for pleasure."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>When he shot a glance at Matterson and Captain Jones,
my eyes followed his, and I saw that once more they had
fixed their gaze on the top of the table. Now I was actually
unable, so baffling had been their change of front, to
make up my mind whether they were to be suspected or to
be trusted.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gleazen, "we are all agreed. Lay down
your orders, Seth. They'll carry them out to the last
letter."</p>

<p>So Uncle Seth told me where to find Gideon North, and
Neil Gleazen wrote it on a paper,&mdash;<i>in Spanish</i>, mind
you!&mdash;and they put their heads together, every one, to
think up such arguments as would induce Captain North
to return, all with an appearance of enthusiasm that
amazed me and might easily have put my suspicions to
shame but for those other things that had happened.</p>

<p>"I'll be civil to him," Gleazen cried. "And you can tell
him, too, that this is an <i>honest voyage</i>. We're to run no
race with the king's cruisers, Joe."</p>

<p>"Aye," Captain Jones put in, "an able vessel and an
honest voyage."</p>

<p>"With a mountain of treasure to be got," added Matterson.</p>

<p>The three spoke so gravely and straightforwardly now,
that I wondered at their insolence; and as Sim and I got
up to go, not yet quite believing that in reality, and not
in a dream, we were being dispatched into the heart of
that strange city, they accompanied us on deck and told
Arnold Lamont that he was to go with us on our errand,
and saw us safely started in the long boat of the Merry
Jack and Eleanor before returning to their punch.</p>

<p>I could see that Arnold had no liking for the mission,
but while we were in the boat he gave me no explanation
of his uneasiness. Indeed, Sim Muzzy talked so much and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
so fast that, when he once got started, you could scarcely
have thrust the point of a needle into his monologue.</p>

<p>"She's a slaver," he murmured as we pulled away from
the Merry Jack and Eleanor. "A cruel-hearted slaver!
Thank heaven, we're never to have a hand in any such
iniquity as that."</p>

<p>We looked back at the ship, black and gloomy against
the sky, with many men moving about on her deck.</p>

<p>"You're a silly fool," one of the oarsmen cried, having
overheard him, "a man without stomach, heart, or good
red blood."</p>

<p>"Stomach, is it?" Sim retorted. "I'll have you know
I eat my three hearty meals a day and they set well too.
I can eat as much victuals as the next man. Why&mdash;"
And there was no stopping him till the boat bumped
against a wharf and we three stepped out.</p>

<p>The boat, I noticed, instead of putting back to the ship,
waited by the wharf.</p>

<p>I turned and looked at the restless harbor, on which each
light was reflected as a long, tremulous finger of flame that
reached almost to my feet, at the sky, in which the stars
were now shining, and at the anchored ships, each with
her own story, could one but have read it; then I yielded
to Sim's importunate call and in the darkness turned after
him and Arnold. What reason was there to suspect that
Simeon Muzzy and I stood at a crossroads where our
paths divided?</p>

<p>Coming to the street, we stopped, and in the light from
an open window put our heads together over the paper
that Gleazen had written out and given to us with instructions
to show it to the first person we met and turn
where he pointed.</p>

<p>"Why, it's all in foreigner's talk!" Sim exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Arnold.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at it a long time and smiled. "I wonder," he
said, "do they think we are so very simple?"</p>

<p>Now a man came toward us. Before he could pass,
Arnold stepped suddenly forward and <i>addressed him in
Spanish</i>.</p>

<p>"Why," cried I, when the passerby had gone, "you, too&mdash;do
you talk Spanish?"</p>

<p>Arnold turned to me with a smile and said, for the second
time, "A man does not tell all he knows."</p>

<p>Thrusting the paper into his pocket, he continued, "According
to the directions that Mr. Gleazen has written
down for our guidance, my friends, we should turn to the
right. But according to my personal knowledge, which that
man confirmed, we shall find Gideon North by turning to
the left."</p>

<p>To the left, then, we turned; and only Arnold Lamont,
who told me of it afterward, saw one of the boatmen, when
we had definitely taken our course, leave the boat and run
into the darkness in the direction that Neil Gleazen wished
to send us.</p>

<p>Carriages passed us, and men on horseback, and negroes
loitering along the streets. There were bright lights in the
windows; and we saw ladies and their escorts riding in
queer two-wheeled vehicles that I later learned were called
<i>volantes</i>.</p>

<p>All was strange and bizarre and extraordinarily interesting.
Never did three men from a little country village
in New England find themselves in a more utterly foreign
city. But although Sim and I had our eyes open for every
new sight, I was nevertheless aware that Arnold was more
alert than either of us, and twice he urged us to keep our
eyes and wits about us.</p>

<p>Seeing nothing to fear, I inclined to smile at him. I now
assumed that I was the bolder and more sophisticated of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the two of us. As we tramped along in the darkness, I
got over the sense of unreality and felt as much at home
in that alien city as if I had been back in the familiar
streets and lanes of Boston.</p>

<p>Three times Arnold stopped to inquire the way; and the
last time the man of whom he asked directions pointed at
a house not a hundred yards distant and said, with a bow,
"It is there, seor."</p>

<p>That he spoke in English, which he had heard Sim and
me use, so surprised us that for the moment we were off
our guard. I was vaguely aware of hearing many feet
trampling along, and afterwards I realized that I had absently
noticed the rumble of voices; but the city was all
so strange that I thought nothing of either the feet or the
voices, and gave all my attention to the stranger. He was
turning away, bowing and protesting his pleasure in serving
us, when Sim Muzzy said in a wondering tone, "Why,
Arnold,&mdash;Joe,&mdash;how many people there are hereabouts!
Look there!"</p>

<p>Arnold, turning as the poor fellow spoke, seized my
arm. "<i>Mon dieu!</i>" he gasped, startled into his native
French. Then in English he cried, "Quick, Joe! Quick!
<i>Vite!</i> Ha! Strike out, Sim, strike!"</p>

<p>Around us there were indeed many men. They were approaching
us from ahead and behind. Suddenly, fiercely,
three or four of them rushed at us.</p>

<p>From his belt Arnold drew a knife and thrust at a man
who had caught my collar. I lost no time in leaping free.</p>

<p>Two of them, now, were upon Arnold, crying out in
Spanish; but he eluded them by a quick turn.</p>

<p>I first saw him spring out of their reach, then an arm,
flung round my throat, cut my wind. As I throttled, I
saw Arnold come charging back again, knife in hand. The
blade slashed past my ear so closely that it cut the skin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
something spurted over my neck and the back of my head,
and the arm that held me fell.</p>

<p>Arnold, his hand on my shoulder, dragged me free.
Stooping, he picked up a stone and hurled it into the midst
of our assailants, eliciting a screech of pain and anger.
When I bent to follow his example, I saw a chance light
flash on his knife-blade. But where, I thought, is Sim?
Then, somewhere in the crowd, I heard him choking and
gagging. My first impulse was to rush to his rescue, but
instantly I saw the folly of such a course, so greatly were
we outnumbered. For a moment Arnold and I held them
off. Just behind us was a street corner. As we darted
toward it, one man dashed out from the crowd, the rest
followed, and a second time, with hoarse shouts, they
charged down upon us. They came in a solid phalanx,
but we rounded the corner and fled. At top speed we
raced down the street and round a second corner. Distancing
them for the moment, but with their yells ringing
in our ears, we scrambled up over a wrought-iron gate
that gave us hold for fingers and feet, through a garden
rich with palms and statuary, over another gate and
across still another street. There we scaled one gate more,
and throwing ourselves down in some dense vines, lay
quietly and got back our breath, while our eluded pursuers
raced and called on the street outside.</p>

<p>The last thing I had heard as we ran was poor Sim
Muzzy screaming for help.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;wh-wh-o&mdash;wh-what&mdash;were th-they?" I
gasped out.</p>

<p>"I believe it to have been a press-gang," Arnold replied.
He, too, was gasping for breath, but he better controlled
his voice.</p>

<p>After a time he added, "Poor Sim! I fear that he is now
on his way into the service of the royal navy of Spain."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," I returned, "they cannot hold an American
citizen."</p>

<p>"Lawfully," said he, "they cannot."</p>

<p>"Then we'll soon have Sim out again."</p>

<p>To this, he did not reply. He said merely, "You and I,
Joe, must keep it a secret between us that I speak their
language."</p>

<p>We lay a long time in the garden, with the stars shining
above us and yellow lights streaming out of the house, and
I thought of how skillfully Arnold Lamont had concealed
his interest in what Gleazen and Matterson had said in a
language they thought none of us could understand. But
when the racing and shouting had gone, and come, and
gone again, and when we both were convinced that all
danger was past, we rose and stretched ourselves and went
up to the house and knocked.</p>

<p>As the door swung open, a flood of light poured out into
the garden; but we saw only an old negro, who stood like
a black shadow in our way and assailed us with a broadside
of angry Spanish. His gray head shook with fury, I
suppose at finding us in the garden, and he spread his
arms to keep us from entering the house. Behind him
arose a hubbub, and an angry white man came rushing
out. When to his fierce questions Arnold shot back
prompt answers, his anger died, and tolerance took its
place, and finally a wave of cordiality swept over his face.
Stepping back he actually flung the door wide open and
with stately bows ushered us into the high-studded hall.
Then the negro went bustling down the passage and spoke
in a low voice, and I was amazed beyond measure to see
Gideon North himself step out of a lighted room.</p>

<p>In our flight Arnold, shrewd, quick to think and to act,
had led us to the garden in the rear of the very house of
which we had come in search.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Captain North, when, after warm greetings
and quick explanations, we were seated together behind
closed doors, "of all that rascally crew in the cabin
of the Adventure, you two are the only ones I should be
glad to see again. How in the name of Beelzebub, prince
of devils, did you light upon my lodging-house, and what
has brought you here?"</p>

<p>Now Gleazen had suggested various arguments by
which to bring Captain North back to his command, and
not the least of them was an apology of a kind from himself;
but they had all lacked sincerity, and as I knew well
enough that Gleazen really would be very sorry if we
should succeed in our errand, I had wisely determined to
have none of them. It is exceedingly doubtful, however,
if I should have dared to speak quite as plainly as did
Arnold Lamont.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "we have come on a strange errand. We
ask you to return to a ship where you have suffered indignities,
to resume a command that you have resigned
under just provocation, to help a man who, I fear, has
forfeited every right to call upon you for help."</p>

<p>"I'm no hand for riddles," said Gideon North. "Talk
plain sea-talk."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Arnold, "I ask you to come back as captain
of the Adventure, to save Seth Upham from his&mdash;friends."
Arnold smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"Blast Upham and his friends!"</p>

<p>"As you will. But that pair of leeches will get the blood
from his heart, and Joe Woods, his heir, will lose every
penny of his inheritance."</p>

<p>"Upham should have thought of that before. Leave
him alone. He lies in the bed he made."</p>

<p>"He, poor man, does not think of it now. Indeed, I fear
he's beyond saving."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Gideon North got up and went to the barred windows
that opened upon the street.</p>

<p>"What is this wild-goose chase?" he suddenly demanded.</p>

<p>"Exactly what the object is I do not know," Arnold replied.
"They talk of a treasure, but they are fit to rule an
empire of liars. They are not, I believe, equipped for the
slave trade, though of that you are a better judge than I."</p>

<p>Still Gideon North stood by the window. Without
turning his head, he remarked, "I wonder why <i>they</i> want
me back."</p>

<p>"They?" At that Arnold laughed. "<i>They</i> do not want
you. Not they! Seth Upham insisted against their every
wish. We came to your door with a press-gang at our
heels. <i>They</i> planned that Joe and I should share Sim
Muzzy's fate and never see you again&mdash;or them."</p>

<p>Thereupon Captain North turned about.</p>

<p>"I am interested," he said. "Aye, and tempted."</p>

<p>He stood for a while musing on all he had heard; then
he smiled in a way that gave me confidence.</p>

<p>"We are three honest men with one purpose," he said;
"but Gleazen and Matterson are a pair of double-dyed
villains. I go into this affair knowing that it is at the risk
of my life, but so help me! I'll take the plunge."</p>

<p>After a pause he added, "You spend the night with me,
lads, and we will go on board together in the morning.
That alone will give 'em a pretty start, for I've no doubt
they think already that they're well rid of the three of us,
and by sun-up they'll be sure of it. What's more, we'll go
armed, lads, knives in our belts and pistols in our boots."</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="small">ISSUES SHARPLY DRAWN</span></h3>

<p>We breakfasted next morning with Gideon North, and
discussed in particular Gleazen and Matterson and in
general affairs on board the Adventure. It seemed ages ago
that I had first seen Gleazen on the porch of the old tavern
in Topham. I told all I knew of how he had come to
town and had won the confidence of so many people, of
how the blacksmith alone had stood out against him, and
of how that last wild night had justified the blacksmith in
every word that he had uttered.</p>

<p>Then Arnold Lamont took up the story and told of
scores of things that I had not perceived: little incidents
that his keen eyes had detected, such as secret greetings
passed between Gleazen and men with whom he pretended
to have nothing whatever to do; chance phrases that I,
too, had overheard, but that only Arnold's native shrewdness
had translated aright; until I blushed with shame to
think how great had been my own vanity and conceit&mdash;I
who thought I had known so much, but really had
known so little!</p>

<p>Then Captain North in blunt language told of things
that had happened on board the Adventure, which made
Uncle Seth out to be a poor, helpless dupe, and ended by
saying vigorously, "Seth Upham is truly in a bad way,
what with Gleazen and Matterson; and brave lads though
you are, you're not their kind. Unless you two were
smarter than human, they'd get you in the end, for they're
cruel men, with no regard for human life, and the odds are
all in their favor; but three of us in the cabin is quite another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
matter. We'll see what we can do to turn the cat in
the pan.</p>

<p>"And now,"&mdash;he pushed his dishes away and set his
elbows on the table,&mdash;"now for facts to work upon. The
pair of them are going to Africa with a purpose. Am I not
right?"</p>

<p>The question required no answer, but Arnold and I both
nodded.</p>

<p>"A cargo's all well and good, and they've no objection
to turning an honest dollar, just because it's honest; but
there's more than honest dollars in this kettle of fish."</p>

<p>Again we nodded.</p>

<p>"Now, then, my lads, let me tell you this: when they've
got what they want in Africa, whatever it may be, when
they've squeezed Seth Upham's last dollar out of his wallet,
when they no longer need honest men on board to
protect them from cruising men-o'-war, then, lads, they're
going to throw you and me to the sharks. As yet, it is too
soon to strike against them. The odds are in their favor
still, and as far as we're concerned there's no hope in
Seth Upham, for they've got him twirling on a spit. It
is for us, lads, to go through with them to the very end,
to walk up and shake hands with death and the devil if
worst comes to worst, but to be ready always to strike
when the iron's hot,&mdash;aye, to strike till the sparks fly
white."</p>

<p>So there we sealed our compact, Arnold Lamont and
Gideon North and I, with no vows and with scant assertions,
but with a completeness of understanding and accord
that gave us, every one, unquestioning confidence in
each of our associates. The fate of poor Sim Muzzy, which
Arnold and I had so narrowly escaped, was still perilously
close at hand; and in returning to the brig, which Gideon
North had left in anger, we shared a common danger that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
bound our alliance more firmly than any pledge would have
bound it.</p>

<p>Our breakfast eaten, we sorted over some pistols that
Captain North had ordered sent from a shop, and chose,
each of us, a pair, for which our host insisted on standing
scot; then he paid the bill for his lodgings, and, armed
against whatever the future might bring, and firmly
resolved that Gleazen and Matterson should not beat us
in a matter of wits, we went into the street.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful almost beyond belief, and the
streets of Havana were full of wonderful sights; but with
the memory of poor Sim's sad fate in mind, and with our
hearts set on the long contest that we must wage, we saw
little of what went on around us. Followed by two negroes,
who between them carried Captain North's bag, we boldly
marched three abreast down through the city to the harbor-side,
where we hailed a boatman and hired him to take
us out to the brig.</p>

<p>Coming up to the gangway, Captain North loudly
called, "Ahoy there!"</p>

<p>There was a rush to the side of the brig, and a dozen
faces looked down at us; but none of them were the faces
that we most desired to see.</p>

<p>"Ho!" Captain North exclaimed, "they're not here.
You there, pass a line, and step lively. Two of you bear
a hand to lift this bag on board."</p>

<p>At that moment we heard steps, and a newcomer appeared
at the rail. It was Cornelius Gleazen. As he stared
at us without a word, he appeared to be the most surprised
man that ever I had seen.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Gleazen," Captain North called.
"I've got your messages and thank you kindly. I reciprocate
all good wishes and I'm sure when anyone comes
out with a handsome apology, I'm no man to bear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
grudge. I resume command with no hard feelings. Good-morning,
sir."</p>

<p>By that time he was on deck and advancing aft.</p>

<p>I had already seen Cornelius Gleazen in some extraordinary
situations, and later I was to see him in certain situations
beside which the others paled to milk and water, but
never at any other time, from the moment when I first saw
him on the porch at the tavern until the day when we
parted not to meet again this side of Judgment, did I see
Cornelius Gleazen affected in just the way that he was affected
then.</p>

<p>He backed away from Captain North, replied loudly as
if in greeting, still backed away, and finally turned and
went below, where evidently he recovered his powers of
speech, for up came my uncle with Matterson at his heels.</p>

<p>"Captain North," Uncle Seth cried, meeting him with
right hand outstretched, "I declare I'm glad you're back
again, and I'm sure that all will go well from this time on."</p>

<p>There was real pathos in Uncle Seth's eagerness to secure
the friendship of the stout captain. In his straight-forward,
confiding manner there was no suggestion of his
old sharpness and pompousness. To see him looking from
one of us to another, so frankly pleased that we had returned,
you could not have failed to know that he was
sincere, and if any of us had had the least suspicion that
Seth Upham had condoned the scheme to have us fall
into the hands of the press-gang, he lost it there and then
forever.</p>

<p>"But where," he cried, glancing down the deck, "where
is Sim Muzzy?"</p>

<p>Matterson came a step nearer. I saw some of the sailors
look curiously at one another. A stir ran along the
deck.</p>

<p>It was Gideon North who replied. "I am told," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
deliberately, letting his eyes wander from face to face,
"that he has fallen into the clutches of a press-gang."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"A press-gang. But of that, Lamont, here, can tell you
better than I."</p>

<p>And Arnold, in his precise, subtly foreign way, told all
that had happened.</p>

<p>Completely stunned, my poor uncle went to the rail and
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>As for Matterson, he shook hands with Captain North
and nodded at the rest of us impartially.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you back, sir," he said. "As you know,
without doubt, I've shipped as chief mate."</p>

<p>"You've what?" Captain North thundered, looking up
at the big man before him.</p>

<p>"Shipped as chief mate, sir."</p>

<p>"Is this true?" the captain demanded, turning on Uncle
Seth.</p>

<p>"It is," my uncle replied like a man just waking. "Mr.
Gleazen and I talked it over&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain North interrupted him without ceremony.
"Well," said he to Matterson, "I've no doubt you'll make
a competent officer."</p>

<p>His abruptness left Matterson no excuse for replying;
so, when the captain went below, the chief mate stepped
over to the rail. There, frowning slightly now and then, he
remained for a long time. It did not take Arnold Lamont's
intuition to perceive that he, as well as Gleazen, was puzzled
and disappointed by the way things had turned out.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="small">LAND HO!</span></h3>

<p>With Captain North back on board again, we felt great
confidence for the future; and while we remained in Havana
there was no other attempt, so far as I know, to do
us harm. But there was that in the wind which kept us
always uneasy; and at no time after the night when Sim
Muzzy left us, never to return to the brig Adventure, did
we have a moment of complete security.</p>

<p>Every one asked questions about poor Sim, and by
the way the various ones received our answers they indicated
much of their own attitude toward us. Abe Guptil
was moved almost to tears, and most of the men forward
shook their heads sympathetically, although in my presence,
since I was not one of them, they said little. But
Matterson would smile with a certain unkind satisfaction,
and Neil Gleazen would laugh softly, and here and there
some one or other of the men would make sly jests or cast
sidelong glances at Arnold and me.</p>

<p>Of all the men on board, Seth Upham was conspicuously
the most disturbed; and as he gloomily paced the deck,&mdash;a
practice he continued even after Captain North had returned,&mdash;I
heard him more than once murmuring to himself,
"Sim, Sim, O my poor Sim! Into what a plight I have
led you!"</p>

<p>Arnold and I suggested in the cabin that we send out a
searching party to see what we could learn of Sim's fate,
and Uncle Seth urged it madly upon the others; but
Gleazen and Matterson would hear nothing of it, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Gideon North told us frankly that he regarded such measures
as hopeless.</p>

<p>"The man's gone and I'm sorry," he said; "but I honestly
believe it is useless for us to try to help him now."</p>

<p>So, reluctantly, we dropped the matter, after reporting
it both to the local authorities and to our own consul; for
however deeply we distrusted Gleazen and Matterson, in
Captain North we had implicit faith.</p>

<p>To prepare for the voyage, we took on board in the next
few days supplies of divers kinds, and though I had learned
much by now of the ways of life at sea, many of the things
puzzled me. One day it was a vast number of empty
water-casks; another day, more than a hundred barrels of
farina; yet another day, a boatload of beans and one of
lumber. There were mysterious gatherings in the cabin
from which Arnold and I were excluded,&mdash;we could not
fail to notice that they took place when Captain North
was ashore,&mdash;but to which gentry with dingy wristbands
and shiny faces were bid; and presently we saw stowed
away forward iron boilers and iron bars, a great box of
iron spoons, a heap of rusty shackles, and still puzzling,
although perhaps less so, a mighty store of gunpowder.</p>

<p>All this occasioned a long argument between Arnold and
Captain North and myself, which fully enlightened me
concerning the purpose of the mysterious supplies. But
reluctant though we were to take the goods on board, there
was nothing that we could do to stop it so long as my
uncle, under Gleazen's influence, insisted on it; for as
owner of the brig, and in that particular port where contraband
trade played so important a part, he could have
had us even jailed, if necessary, to carry his point. Our
only way to serve him best in the end was to stand by in
silence and let the stores, such as they were, go into the
hold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>All the time my uncle came and went in a silence so
deep that, if I had not now and then caught his eyes fixed
upon me with a sadness that revealed, more than words,
how unhappy he was, I could scarcely have believed that
he was the same Seth Upham in whose house I had lived
so long. From a person of importance in his own town and
a leader among those of us who had set forth with him,
he had fallen to a place so shameful that I felt for him
the deepest concern, and for the precious villains that
were thus dishonoring my mother's brother, the deepest
anger.</p>

<p>"There are no pirates on the seas nowadays," I remarked
one morning to Neil Gleazen who stood beside me
watching all that went forward&mdash;and all the time I
watched his face. "Why then should we set out armed
to fight a sloop-of-war? Or ship a pair of small-swords on
the cabin bulkhead?"</p>

<p>"Trade and barter, Joe," he replied. "The niggers
fairly tumble over themselves to buy such tricks. There's
money in it, Joe." Then he laughed as if mightily pleased
with himself.</p>

<p>"But," I persisted, scarcely veiling my impatience,
"you've said more than once that trade is not the object
of our voyage."</p>

<p>"True, Joe." He lowered his voice. "But that's no
reason to neglect a chance to turn our money over. Ah,
Joe, you're a good lad, and we must have a bout with the
foils some day soon. I'm sure we'll get along well together,
you and I."</p>

<p>He smiled and clapped me on the shoulder; but the old
spell was broken, and when he had gone, I ruminated for a
long time on one thing and another that had occurred in
the past months.</p>

<p>That evening, when Arnold and I stood with Gideon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
North abaft the wheel where there was no one to overhear
us, Arnold and the honest captain would have confirmed
my worst suspicions, had they needed to be confirmed.
But by then I had observed as much as they, and we
talked only in such vague terms as pleased our mood.</p>

<p>"No! There's more to this voyage than has appeared
on the surface even yet," Captain North said in an undertone.</p>

<p>"I have heard them talking in Spanish," said Arnold
Lamont, "of gold&mdash;and of other things&mdash;of two men
on the coast&mdash;and of a ship wrecked at the hour they
needed her most. They share a great secret. They have
come scarred through more than one fight and have lost
the vessel on which they counted to make their fortunes.
They are taking us back now, perhaps to fight for them,
perhaps to run for them, but always as their creatures. So
much I, too, have learned. We must walk circumspectly,
my friends. We must keep always together and guard always
against treachery. <i>Mon dieu!</i> what men they are!"</p>

<p>It was the longest speech I had ever heard Arnold make.</p>

<p>Next day, following the arrival of a boatload of as rascally
looking mariners as ever attempted to ship on board
a reputable vessel, there ensued a quarrel so sudden and
violent and so directly concerned with our fortunes, that
Arnold and I hung in breathless suspense on the issue.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," Gideon North cried, hammering the cabin
table with his fist, "as captain of this brig, I and I alone
will say who shall ship with me and who shall not. I'll not
have my crew packed with vagabonds and buccaneers.
I'll turn those fellows back on shore, be it bag in hand and
clothes upon them, or be it as stark naked as they came
into this world, and I'll have you leave my crew alone
from this day forth."</p>

<p>Matterson laughed lightly. "Ah, captain," he said, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
bitter sarcasm, "you are so excitable. They are able men.
I'll answer for them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Matterson," the captain retorted, "it devolves
upon you to answer for yourself, which bids fair to be no
easy task."</p>

<p>"But," roared Gleazen, cursing viciously, "the owner
says they're to come. And, by heaven, you'll cram them
down your throat."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense&mdash;"</p>

<p>By this time I felt that I could hold my peace no longer.
Certainly I was party to whatever agreement should be
reached. "You lie!" I cried to Gleazen, "the owner said
nothing of the kind!"</p>

<p>"How about it, Seth, how about it?" Gleazen demanded,
disdainfully ignoring me. "Speak out your orders,
speak 'em out or&mdash;" the man's voice dropped until
it rumbled in his throat "&mdash;or&mdash;you know what."</p>

<p>Poor Seth Upham had thought himself so strong and
able and shrewd! So he had been in little Topham. But
neither the quick wit nor the native courage necessary to
cope with desperate, resolute men was left to him now.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" he stammered. "Take one or two of them,
Captain North, just one or two,&mdash;do that for me, I beg
you,&mdash;and let the rest go."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Gideon North.</p>

<p>"One or two?" Gleazen thundered, "one or two? Only
one or two?"</p>

<p>Instantly both men had turned upon my uncle. Both
men, their eyes narrowed, their jaws out-thrust, faced him
in hot anger. There was a moment of dreadful silence;
then, to my utter amazement, my uncle actually got down
on his knees in front of Neil Gleazen, down on his marrow
bones on the bare boards, and wailed, "In the name of
Heaven, Neil, don't tell! Don't tell!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<div class="p2 figcenter">
<img src="images/illus_0384.jpg" width="334" height="500" alt="Pleading with Neil to not tell." /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>In the name of Heaven, Neil, don&#39;t tell! Don&#39;t tell!</i></p>

<p>While we stared at him, Gideon North, Arnold, and I,
literally doubting what our eyes told us was the plain
truth, Matterson said lightly, as if he were speaking of a
sick and fretful child, "Let him have it, Neil. I hate
scenes. Keep only Pedro."</p>

<p>Gideon North looked first at my uncle, then at Matterson,
and then back at my uncle. As if to a certain extent
moved by the scene that we had just witnessed, he said no
more; so of five strange seamen, next day all save one went
ashore again.</p>

<p>That brief, fierce quarrel had revealed to us, as nothing
else could have, into what a desperately abject plight
my uncle had fallen. At the time it shocked me beyond
measure. It was so pitifully, so inexpressibly disgraceful!
In all the years that have passed since that day in Havana
harbor I have not been able to forget it; to this moment I
cannot think of it without feeling in my cheeks the hot
blood of shame.</p>

<p>The man whom Matterson chose to keep on board the
Adventure appeared to be a good-natured soul, and he
went by the name of Pedro. What other name he had, if
any, I never knew; but no seafaring man who ever met
him needed another name. Years afterwards, down on old
Long Wharf in Boston, I elicited an exclamation of amazement
by saying to a sailor who had slyly asked me for the
price of a glass of beer, "Did you ever know a seafaring
man named Pedro who had a pet monkey?"</p>

<p>By his monkey I verily believe the man was known in
half the ports of the world. He came aboard with the grinning,
chattering beast, which seemed almost as big as himself,
perched on his shoulder. He made it a bed in his own
bunk, fed it from his own dipper, and always spoke affectionately
of it as "my leetle frien'."</p>

<p>The beast was uncannily wise. There was something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
veritably Satanic in the leers with which it would regard
the men, and before we crossed the ocean, as I shall relate
shortly, it became the terror of Willie MacDougald's life.</p>

<p>So far as most of us could see, we were now ready to
weigh anchor and be off; but by my uncle's orders we
waited one day more, and on the morning of that day
Uncle Seth and Neil Gleazen went on shore together.</p>

<p>When after a long absence they returned, they had
words with Captain North; and though we had become
used by now to quarrels between Gleazen and the captain,
there was a different tone in this one, which puzzled Arnold
and me.</p>

<p>Presently the two and my uncle went below, where Matterson
joined them; and except for Willie MacDougald,
Arnold and I might never have known what took place.
But Willie MacDougald, knocking at our stateroom door
that night, thrust his small and apparently innocent face
into the cabin, entered craftily and said, "If you please,
sir, I've got news worth a pretty penny."</p>

<p>"How much is it worth?" Arnold asked.</p>

<p>"A shilling," Willie whispered.</p>

<p>"That is a great deal of money."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I've got news that's worth it."</p>

<p>"I shall be the judge of that," Arnold responded.</p>

<p>Willie squinted up his face and whispered, "They've got
new papers."</p>

<p>"How so?" Arnold demanded. He did not yet understand
what Willie meant.</p>

<p>"Why, new papers. Portuguese papers."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Arnold. "Forged, I suppose? Shall we not
sail under the American flag?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir, but the schooner Shark and the sloop of
war Ontario are to be sent across for cruising."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Seth Upham's sold the brig."</p>

<p>"Sold it!" Arnold exclaimed. For the moment both he
and I thought that Willie was lying to us.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir. To be delivered in Africa. Half the money
down, and half on delivery."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said the crafty youngster, who understood
better than either of us the various subterfuges to which
African traders resorted in order to elude searching cruisers,
"all they have to do to change registry is to say she's
delivered to the new owners, and fly a new flag and show
the bill of sale."</p>

<p>"Go on, go on. Must I drag the story from you word
by word?"</p>

<p>"Captain North, sir, said he'd be hanged first; and Mr.
Gleazen said he'd be hanged anyway; and ain't that worth
two bits?"</p>

<p>Arnold flung a coin to the grasping little wretch, and he
went out and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>It was dark just outside our stateroom, and neither
Willie nor we had been able to see anything that might
have been there. For half a minute after Willie left us,
while he was feeling his way toward the cabin, all was still.
Then he suddenly shrieked so wildly that we leaped from
our berths.</p>

<p>There was a sound of crashing and bumping. Even
wilder shrieks filled the air, and we heard a curious chattering
and mumbling. Something fell against the stateroom
door and cracked a panel, the door flew open, and in
toppled Willie with Pedro's monkey grasping him firmly
by the throat from its perch on the little fellow's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Help, help!" Willie shrieked. "Lord save me! It's
the devil! Help! I repent! I repent!" And he tripped
and fell with a crash.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>As he fell, the coin flew out of his hand, and the monkey,
seeing the flash of silver, leaped after it, picked it up, fled
like a lean brown shadow through the door, and was gone
we knew not where.</p>

<p>To this day I am not able to make up my mind whether
the child's anger or his fear was the greater. Turning
like a flash, he saw what it was that had attacked him;
yet he made no move to pursue the beast, and from that
time on he regarded it with exceedingly great caution and
nimbly and prudently betook himself out of its way.
Canny, scheming, selfish Willie MacDougald!</p>

<p>At peep of dawn we got up our anchors and set sail and
put out to sea, carrying with us heavy knowledge of perils
and dangers that encompassed us, and sad memories of
our old home in Topham, of our old friends in trouble, of
high hopes that had fallen into ruin.</p>

<p>It comforted me to see Abraham Guptil working with
the crew. He stood in good repute with every man on
board, from Matterson and Gleazen to little Willie MacDougald,
who now was in the steerage watching with
great, round eyes all that went on about him. Good Abe
Guptil! He, at least, concealed no diabolical craft beneath
an innocent exterior.</p>

<p>I thought of Sim Muzzy. Poor Sim! Since he had disappeared
that night in the clutches of the press-gang, nothing
that we had been able to do had called forth a single
word of his whereabouts. He had vanished utterly, and
though neither Arnold nor I had ever felt any great affection
for the garrulous fellow, we both were sincerely
grieved to lose an old companion thus unhappily.</p>

<p>Now, as our sails filled, we swept past the Merry Jack
and Eleanor, and the sight came to me like a shock of ill
omen. The black disgrace of her lawless trade, the brutal
men who manned her, the sinister experience that had followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
so closely our call upon her captain, all combined to
make me feel that the shadow she had cast upon us was
not easily to be evaded.</p>

<p>It was good to turn back once more to solid, substantial
Gideon North, firm, wise Arnold Lamont, and kindly,
trustworthy Abe Guptil. On them and on me Uncle Seth's
fortunes and my own depended, if not indeed our very
lives.</p>

<p>Mr. Matterson handled the brig from the forecastle and
handled her ably. Not even Captain North, who watched
him constantly with searching eyes, could find a thing of
which to complain. His almost feminine voice took on a
cutting quality that reached each man on board and conveyed
by its hard, keen edge a very clear impression of
what would happen if aught should go astray. But there
was that about him which made it impossible to trust
him; and Gleazen, seeming by his airs far more the owner
than my poor, cowed uncle, stood by Gideon North and
looked the triumph that he felt.</p>

<p>So we passed between the castle and the battery and
showed our heels to Cuba and set our course across the sea
and lived always on guard, always suspicious, yet never
confirming further our suspicions, until, weeks later, the
lookout at the masthead cried, "Land ho!"</p>

<p>The low, dark line that appeared far on the horizon, to
mark the end of an uncommonly tranquil passage, so pleasantly
in contrast to our voyage to Cuba, deepened and
took form. There was excitement forward and aft. Gleazen
and Matterson clapped hands on shoulders and roared
their delight and cried that now,&mdash;they were vile-mouthed,
profane men,&mdash;that now neither God nor devil should
thwart them further.</p>

<p>Through the ship the word went from lip to lip that
yonder lay the coast of Guinea.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>It had become natural to us in the cabin to align ourselves
on one side or the other. Gleazen and Matterson
stood shoulder to shoulder, and Gideon North and Arnold
Lamont and I gathered a little farther aft. We acted unconsciously,
for all of us were intent on the land that we
had raised; and my poor uncle, apparently assuming
neither friend nor enemy, leaned against the cabin all
alone. His face was averted and I could catch only a
glimpse of his profile; but I was convinced that I saw his
lip tremble.</p>

<p>Yonder, in truth, lay the coast of Guinea, and there at
last every one of us was to learn the secret of that mad expedition
which had so long since set forth from the little
New England town of Topham.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="small">THE ISLAND</span></h3>

<p>To the dark land on the sky-line, we swiftly drew
nearer, and presently saw a low shore where a thread of
gleaming white, which came and went, told us unmistakably
that great seas were breaking. Of the exact point
that we had reached on the coast we still were in doubt,
for our charts were poor and Captain North suspected the
quadrant of having developed some fault of a nature so
technical that I neither understood it at the time nor now
remember its name; so we hove to, while Gleazen and
Matterson and Gideon North, and eventually Mr. Severance,
of whom I saw less and thought more seldom than
of any other man in the cabin, put their heads together
and argued the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Severance was a good enough man in his place, I
suppose, but he was too indolent and self-centred, and too
sleepily fond of his pipe, to command attention.</p>

<p>For all the headway that the four seemed to be making,
they might have argued until the crack of doom, as far as
I could see, when from the masthead came the cry,
"Sail ho!"</p>

<p>Matterson and Gleazen faced about, as quickly as
weasels on a stone wall, and Gideon North was not much
behind them.</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"Off the larboard bow!"</p>

<p>"What do you make her out?" Captain North demanded.</p>

<p>"As yet, sir, she's too far off to be seen clearly."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>I had known that we were sailing dangerous seas, but
nothing else had so vividly brought our dangers home to
me as did the scene of desperate activity that now ensued.
Hoarse orders went booming up and down the decks.
Men sprang to braces and halyards. For a moment the
foresail, newly let fall, roared in the wind, then, clapping
like thunder, it filled, as the men tailed on tack and sheet,
and catching the wind, stiffened like iron. Wearing ship,
we set every stitch of our canvas, and with a breeze that
drove us like a greyhound through the long, swiftly running
seas, went lasking up the coast of Africa, as, intently
training glasses across the taffrail, we waited to see more
of the strange vessel.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding our feverish efforts to elude her, she
had drawn slowly nearer, and we made out that she was a
schooner and as fleet as a bird. For a time there was talk
of the armed schooner Shark, which our own government
was reported to have sent out to cruise for slavers.</p>

<p>It was with grim interest that we watched her every
man&#339;&oelig;uvre. Our men forward would constantly turn their
heads to study her more closely, and those of us aft kept
our eyes fixed upon her. Swift as was the Adventure, it
was plain from the first that the schooner was outsailing
her in a way that seemed almost to savor of wizardry.</p>

<p>"I swear I can see the hangman's knot in her halyard,"
Gleazen cried, and roundly braced his oath. "Never before
did I feel such an itching on my neck."</p>

<p>At that Gideon North sternly said, "If she's a government
vessel, gentlemen, I can assure you that we will not
run from her. We have committed no crime; we carry no
contraband. It is not government vessels I fear."</p>

<p>"There's reason in that, too!" Gleazen muttered. "Yes,
I'd as soon swing, as go over the side with my throat slit."
Then, caustically, he added, "No! Oh, no! We've no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
contraband, you say. So we haven't. But we have enough
water-casks for three hundred men, and lumber for extra
decks, and shackles and nigger food."</p>

<p>Gideon North flamed red and started to respond angrily;
but Matterson, with a sly smile, turned the argument
off by saying lightly, "If she's the Shark she's sailing
under false colors. See! She's broken out the flag of
Spain."</p>

<p>"Humph," Captain North grunted, "she's a trader at
best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In either case, Captain North, she is outsailing us, for
all our Baltimore bow and grand spread of canvas," Matterson
interposed. "But never fear, Captain North, Gleazen
and I have a way with us. We have no wish to meet
with any ships of war, but from mere pirates and slavers
we are not, I beg to assure you, in any great danger."</p>

<p>"Humph! The devil looks well after his own."</p>

<p>"The devil," Matterson retorted with an ironical smile,
"is not so bad a master as some men would make him out
to be."</p>

<p>Leaning on the rail, we silently watched the swift,
strange schooner. Above the horizon, so perfectly did the
bright canvas with the sun upon it blend into the background
of sky, we could see only the black shadows that
appeared on the sails just abaft the masts and stays; but
her hull made a clean, bright line against the vivid blue of
the sea, and against that same blue the foot of her mainsail
stood out as sharp and white as if cut from bone.
She continued to gain on us surely all that afternoon, but
our apprehensions, which grew keener as she drew nearer,
were allayed when she stood out to sea and gave us as
wide a berth as we desired. She was a rarely beautiful
sight, when, in the early evening, still far out at sea, she
passed us; and remembering the Merry Jack and Eleanor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in Havana harbor, I could not bear to think that so graceful
a craft might carry sordid sights and smells.</p>

<p>After a time, as the light changed, her sails turned to a
slate-gray touched with dull blue, and with a great blotch
of purple shadow down the middle, where mainsail merged
into staysail and foresail, and foresail into jib. So grim,
now, did she appear in the gathering darkness, that I
could have believed almost anything of her. And now she
was gone! Lost to sight! Vanished into the distant, almost
uncharted waters of the great gulf! Only the memory
of her marvelous swiftness and of the changing light
on her sails was left to us&mdash;that and the memory of one
more angry encounter with Gleazen and Matterson.</p>

<p>That night, while we lay in those long slow seas which
roll in upon the African coast, the two spent hours by the
taffrail in low-voiced conversation, and Gideon North sat
below over his charts and papers, and Arnold and I strolled
about the deck, arm in arm, talking of one project and another.
But my uncle, Seth Upham, the man who owned
the Adventure, paced the deck alone in the moonlight, now
with his head bent as if under the weight of a heavy burden,
now with his head erect and with an air of what
seemed at some moments wild defiance. An odor of tobacco
drifted back to us on the wind from where the carpenter
and the sailmaker were smoking together, and we
heard the voices of men in the forecastle.</p>

<p>When, at daybreak, we resumed our course up the coast,
we knew that we were near the end of our journey, for
Gleazen and Matterson were constantly conferring together
and with Gideon North; and a dozen times in two
hours, one or the other of them charged the masthead man
to keep a smart lookout.</p>

<p>Now Gleazen would lean his elbows on the rail and
search the horizon; now he would hand the glass to Matterson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and stride the deck in a fury of impatience. Below,
the log-book lay open on the cabin table at a blank page,
on which there was a rough pencil-sketch of coast and a
river and an island. On a chart, which lay half open across
a chair, someone had drawn a circle with a pair of compasses,
half on land and half on sea; and when Arnold silently
drew my attention to it, I saw that in the circle
someone had penciled the same sketch that I had seen on
the blank page of the log-book.</p>

<p>Coast, river, and island! We studied the sketch in silence
and talked of it afterward.</p>

<p>That evening, for the first time in many hours, we came
on Captain North alone by the rail.</p>

<p>"Someone has drawn an island on the chart," said Arnold,
slowly.</p>

<p>Gideon North growled assent.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Arnold.</p>

<p>"It would seem that the blithering idiots don't know its
bearings within a hundred miles, and yet they expect me
to bring it straight aboard. One says thus and so; t'other
says so and thus. Gleazen talked loudest and I took his
word first&mdash;like a fool, for he's no navigator. I'd not put
such foolishness beyond Seth Upham, but the others ought
to know better. Aye! And they do know better."</p>

<p>"What island?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He shot a keen glance at me.</p>

<p>"Hm! Have they said naught to you?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>Arnold was smiling.</p>

<p>"Nor to you?" Gideon North demanded, seeing him
smile.</p>

<p>"Nor to me."</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "you two know less than I, and I know
little enough."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you know more than we, pray tell us what you
can?"</p>

<p>"After all," said he, "I only know that we are looking
for an island, and that when we find it the deviltry is yet to
begin&mdash;" He smiled grimly. "We'll yet have a chance
to see sparks fly from those weapons Gleazen hung in the
cabin. I hear he's a clever man at the smallsword."</p>

<p>When he said that, Captain North looked at Arnold and
me as if to question us.</p>

<p>"Clever?" I replied. "Yes, he's clever, though&mdash;"</p>

<p>I then saw that Arnold was smiling. I remembered seeing
him smile when Gleazen and I were fencing on the
green. I remembered his saying that he had not been
laughing at me. And now he was smiling again!</p>

<p>I stammered with embarrassment and clumsily concluded,
"But&mdash;but not so very&mdash;perhaps not very
clever."</p>

<p>In the waist I heard Gleazen call in a low voice, "Masthead!
You there, wake up!"</p>

<p>"Ay-ay, sir," came the man's reply.</p>

<p>"Not so loud," said Gleazen. "Have you seen no lights&mdash;no
land?"</p>

<p>"No lights, sir, and no land but the coast yonder, which
we've seen these two days."</p>

<p>I could just make out that Gleazen was leaning on the
bulwark and staring into the northeast.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" Captain North asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>We both had heard it.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking," Captain North presently muttered,
"that we're like to see more land than will be good for us.
Mark the sky to westward."</p>

<p>It was banked with clouds.</p>

<p>The island, when we found it, which we did early next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
day, proved to be low and flat and marshy. Behind it, exactly
according to the sketch in the log-book and on the
chart, lay the mouth of a river. On the mainland in each
direction, as far as we could see, and on the bar at the
mouth of the river, and on the outer shore of the island,
which seemed to be in the nature of a delta, although with
deep water behind it where the flow of the river appeared
to have kept a Y-shaped channel open, a great surf broke
with muffled roar; and in the channel a ruffle of choppy
waves indicated that stream and tide combined to make a
formidable current.</p>

<p>As we bore down on it, Gleazen and Matterson and Seth
Upham drew apart and stood smiling as they talked together
in undertones. But Captain North and Mr. Severance
and some of the older sailors were studying sky and
wind and currents, and their frowns indicated that much
was amiss.</p>

<p>To me, watching Gleazen and Matterson, it seemed
strange that men who but a little while ago had been so
fiercely eager should all at once become as subdued as
deacons before the communion table; and it was only when
I edged around until I could see Gleazen's face that I suspected
the wild glee that the man was restraining. The
light in his eyes and the change in his expression so fascinated
me that for the moment I almost forgot Arnold Lamont
and Gideon North and the alliance that bound us
together, almost forgot my poor uncle and his wild hopes,
almost forgot the very island whose low and sedgy shores
we were approaching.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," cried Captain North,&mdash;his voice startled
me as much as those whom he addressed,&mdash;"would you
wreck this vessel by keeping me here on a lee shore with
heaven only knows what weather brewing? Look for yourselves
at those clouds in the southwest. If this harbor, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
which you were talking yesterday, is within fifty miles of
us, we must run for it. If not, we must stand off shore and
prepare to ride out the storm."</p>

<p>"The harbor, Captain North," Matterson returned, his
light voice hard with antagonism, "is much less than fifty
miles from here. You will lay by for one hour while we go
ashore on that island yonder; then I will pilot you to
harbor."</p>

<p>"<i>Mister Matterson!</i>" said Captain North calmly, turning
on the giant of a man beside him, "are you mate or
master?"</p>

<p>"Captain North," Matterson very quietly replied, "I
am mate of this vessel, and as mate I do not dictate.
Have I not worked faithfully and well on this voyage?
Have I not carried out every order of yours?"</p>

<p>It was true, for to the surprise of Gideon North and Arnold
and myself, he had made a first-class mate.</p>

<p>"But I also am a friend of the owner and as friend of the
owner, I spoke just now, forgetting my place as mate, I
ask you to pardon me."</p>

<p>In his words and his manner there was something so
oily and insincere that from the bottom of my heart I distrusted
him, and so, obviously enough, did Gideon North.
But the man's sudden change of front took the weapons,
so to speak, out of the captain's hands; and before he
could reply Matterson said, "Mr. Upham, what are your
wishes in the matter?"</p>

<p>I looked first at my uncle, then I looked back at Matterson,
and as I looked at Matterson, I caught a glimpse
over his shoulder of Neil Gleazen, who was staring at
Uncle Seth with a scowl on his brow and with his lips
moving. Turning again to my uncle, I once more saw on
his face, now so weak, the pathetically timid expression
that I had come to know so well.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"If there's no immediate danger&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"There's none at all!" Matterson and Gleazen cried
with one voice.</p>

<p>"Then let us go ashore, say for merely half an hour."</p>

<p>Captain North, with a shrug as of resignation, put the
trumpet to his lips and gave orders that brought the brig
into the wind with sails ashiver.</p>

<p>"Come, lads," Gleazen cried to Arnold and me, "the
more the merrier."</p>

<p>So into the boat we climbed, and I for one was pleased
to find that Abe Guptil had an oar.</p>

<p>It was about half a mile from the brig to the island, and
when we reached it and hauled out the boat, I pushed
ahead of the others. Climbing from the edge of the water
up the little incline at the head of the beach, I saw first of
all, on the farther shore a quarter of a mile away, the ribs
and broken planking of a wrecked ship. Then, before I
had taken another step, I saw some little creature running
through the grass and looked after it eagerly, to discover
what strange kind of animal would inhabit so barren and
remote an isle.</p>

<p>At first I saw only that the animal was long and gray.
Then it came out into plain sight, and I saw that it was
a rat&mdash;an ordinary rat such as I had seen by the hundreds
in old barns and in old ships. And how, I wondered,
had an ordinary rat, such as might slink along the wharves
at Boston, come to live on that lonely island? Before an
answer occurred to me, I saw another running away in a
different direction, and another and another. I stopped
short and looked about me. Here, there, everywhere were
rats. The island was peopled with them. With big gray
rats! Then I looked at the bones of that wrecked ship,
which stuck up out of the water, and knew that I had
found the answer to my question. They were rats from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that ship; they had come ashore when she was wrecked.</p>

<p>What they lived on, I never knew; but there they had
flourished and multiplied and formed in the midst of those
blue seas a great rat empire.</p>

<p>"Rats!" I heard Gleazen exclaim. "Pfaw! How I hate
them!"</p>

<p>Throwing sticks ahead of him to drive away the lean,
gray vermin, he started across the marshy land toward the
old wreck, and the rest of us fell in behind him.</p>

<p>Of us all, Matterson showed the least repugnance for the
multitude of snaky little beasts that swarmed around us at
a distance and watched us with angry eyes as black as shoe
buttons.</p>

<p>And now we came to the wreck and saw a sight that
filled me with horror. In the hold, into which we could
look through holes between the ribs and between the beams
where the waves had torn away the spar deck, there were
five human skeletons chained by their ankle-bones to the
timbers. Yet, so far as there was any outward sign, I was
the only one to see the skeletons.</p>

<p>Matterson and Gleazen looked long and sadly at the old
hulk, and Gleazen finally said, "She's done for and gone,
Molly. There's not a thing left about her that's worth
salving."</p>

<p>Matterson gloomily nodded. "Mr. Upham," said he,
"we lost two hundred prime niggers that night."</p>

<p>I turned away from them, as they stood there talking,
and went back to the boat. It would be good, I thought
while I waited, to leave the island forever.</p>

<p>Whatever the outcome of their talk may have been, the
rising wind presently brought them back to the boat in a
hurry. We launched her, and tumbled aboard, drenched
from head to foot, and after a lively struggle came up alee
of the brig. It was plain that we must soon seek shelter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
for already the storm was blowing up and the waves came
charging down upon us in fierce, racing lines.</p>

<p>"Yonder island," Matterson was saying, at the same
time marking a diagram on the palm of one hand with the
forefinger of the other, "yonder island is part of the delta
of the Rio Polo. It runs so&mdash;and so&mdash;and all but the
island is washed away. You see, do you not, gentlemen?
If Captain North will run straight so,&mdash;northeast by east,
say,&mdash;holding his bearings by the angle of ripples where
you see the current veer, and when we are four cables'
lengths from the breakers give me the wheel, I will take
her over the bar."</p>

<p>"Mr. Matterson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The responsibility is mine, Captain North, by the
owner's orders."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Upham," said the captain, with a wry smile,
"and is this the kind of support you give me?"</p>

<p>Not one word did my uncle say.</p>

<hr class="c65" />

<p>I had seen Pedro's monkey for a while playfully swinging
from rope to rope and later scratching its ear as it sat
on the companion hatch; but I had not seen it go below,
nor had any of the others. To this day no one knows just
how it evaded us, for it was forbidden the cabin, and
every man on board had orders to head it off if it showed
any inclination to go there. Yet the mischievous beast
did slip below, and for once succeeded in catching Willie
MacDougald off his guard.</p>

<p>Willie, it seems, had been engaged in the praiseworthy
occupation of spying on Neil Gleazen, and had one eye
firmly fixed to the keyhole of the cabin door when the monkey
calmly jabbed teeth and claws into the luckless boy's
leg.</p>

<p>His yell startled every man on deck; but far more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
it startled us did it startle the man in the cabin, who had
thought himself safe from peeping eyes.</p>

<p>First we heard Willie yelling with all the power of his
brazen little throat; then the cabin door was flung open
with a bang; then suddenly Willie and the monkey literally
flew out of the companionway and alighted on deck.</p>

<p>The fall was short and neither was much hurt. But
when each tried to escape from the other, both started to
run in the same direction and Willie, tripping, fell on the
monkey. At that, the monkey grabbed Willie's head with
its front claws, raked its hind claws across his face, then
snatching out two good handfuls of hair, fled triumphantly
aloft.</p>

<p>Gleazen burst out on deck at that very instant, and seeing
nothing of Willie who&mdash;luckily for him!&mdash;had fallen
out of sight round the corner of the cabin, started into the
rigging, swearing to skin the monkey alive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Matterson was like to have died laughing at
Willie MacDougald,&mdash;and, indeed, so were the rest of
us!&mdash;for between anger and fear, and with half a dozen
long scratches across his cheeks, he was in a sad state of
mind. I tell you, any ideas of his innocent childhood that
we may have entertained completely vanished before the
flood of oaths that the little wretch was pouring out, when
Gideon North collared him and sent him below with stinging
ears.</p>

<p>And now, since all that takes so long to tell happened
quickly, the breakers were close aboard, when Gleazen,
who had followed the scapegrace monkey to the mizzen
royal yard, roared in that great voice of his:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sail ho! By heaven, there's a cruiser in the offing."</p>

<p>He came down the rigging like a cat, bawling orders as
he came, and at the same time Gideon North was giving
counter-orders. It seemed for a moment that in that scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of confusion, which suddenly from comedy had changed
to the grimmest of grim earnest, we should go on beam-ends
into the surf.</p>

<p>Seas such as I had never dreamed of were breaking on
the bar before us. Overhead a storm was gathering. In
the offing, it was reported, there sailed a strange and hostile
ship. And in the brig Adventure there were contradictory
orders and tangled ropes and men working at cross
purposes.</p>

<p>Say what you will against Matterson in most respects,
in that emergency he was the man who saved us. Throwing
the helmsman from the wheel so violently that he fell
clean over the companion ladder and down to the spar-deck,
he seized the wheel and cried in a voice as hard as
steel, "Gleazen, be still! Be still, I say! Now, Captain
North, with head yards aback and after yards braced for
the starboard tack, we'll make it."</p>

<p>Captain North, with an able man at the wheel,&mdash;to pay
the devil his due,&mdash;gave orders in swift succession and
the brig came back on her course and rose to meet the
breakers. How Matterson so surely and confidently found
the exact channel, I do not know. But this I do know: he
took the brig in through the breakers without the error of
as much as a hair's breadth, straight in along the channel,
with never a mark to guide him that I could see, except
the belt of tidal chop and the eddies of the intermingling
currents, to the comparative quiet of the mouth of a river
that led away before us into the mazes of vast swamps and
tangled waterways, where mangroves and huge interweaving,
overhanging vines and sickly sweet flowers grew
in all the riotous luxury of tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>To me the calm river seemed an amazing haven from
every danger that we had encountered outside. But not
so to Matterson.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking back at the thundering breakers, he thoughtfully
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gleazen significantly, "if worst comes to
worst, we can fight."</p>

<p>"If worst comes to worst."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Matterson shook himself like a dog. "It's the niggers,"
he said in a low voice. "If them infernal witch doctors get
wind of us!"</p>

<p>Gleazen stared a long time into the mangroves.</p>

<p>"It ain't as if we could take an army," Matterson continued.
"We've got to take only them we <i>know</i>&mdash;<i>know</i>,
mind you. What'd our lives be worth if all these here&mdash;"
he waved his hand at the crew forward&mdash;"if all these
here knew. It would pay 'em well to knock us on the
head."</p>

<p>Still Gleazen stared silently into the tangled swamp.</p>

<p>"It would pay 'em well," Matterson repeated.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="small">STRANGEST OF ALL</span></h3>

<p>Even had I not suspected already that Matterson had
brought vessels into the mouth of that river many times
before, I could not have doubted it after seeing him bring
the Adventure through the narrow channel across the bar,
and up to the mouth of the river itself. I marveled that,
having been more than a year away from it,&mdash;how much
more than a year I did not know,&mdash;he dared even attempt
the passage. But whatever his faults, indecision and fear
were not among them, and he had justified his bold course
by bringing us safely within the sheltering bar, where the
lookouts reported minute by minute every movement of
the suspicious distant sail, which approached until from
the deck we could see her courses, and then wore ship to
haul off shore before the storm caught her.</p>

<p>"Bah! The cruising curs!" Matterson scornfully exclaimed.
"Captain North, shall I continue to serve as
pilot and take the brig up the river?"</p>

<p>"Since up the river it seems we are to go," Captain
North returned stiffly, "I place the helm and all responsibility
in your hands, Mr. Matterson." With that he
folded his arms and, with a nod to Seth Upham, withdrew
to the weather-rail.</p>

<p>My poor uncle!</p>

<p>Never was there merer figurehead than he as owner of
the brig Adventure. It was pathetic to see him try to maintain
his dignity and speak and answer smartly, even
sharply as of old, when every man on board knew that if
that reckless, high-handed pair, Gleazen and Matterson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
were at any time to cease tolerating him, his life would
be worth no more than the flame of a snuffed candle. He
must have been perfectly well aware of the weak part he
had played, yet he held up his head and boldly returned
Gideon North's glance and nod.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Matterson had climbed to the masthead and
with glass at eye was studying the stranger. Now he came
slowly down again, and said to Gleazen, "She's bearing
off in good faith to ride out the storm, Neil. What say?
Shall we anchor here behind the bar?"</p>

<p>Gleazen shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's fair shelter," Matterson persisted.</p>

<p>Gleazen waved his hand at the black sky. "But not
shelter enough," he said.</p>

<p>"If we go up the river," said Matterson in a low voice,
"the news will spread from here to the hills."</p>

<p>Gleazen smiled unpleasantly. "Look off the larboard
bow," he said.</p>

<p>We all turned, as did Matterson, and I for one, at first,
saw nothing except the vines and great trees on which fell
the shadows of the premature twilight that foreran the
storm. But Matterson cried out, and Arnold Lamont, seeing
my blank expression, touched my arm and pointed at
a dark lane of water and said, "See&mdash;there&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>Then I saw something moving, and made out a canoe.
In the canoe was a big black negro, with round eyes and
flat nose and huge, puffed-out lips. The negro was paddling.
Then I saw something else. I could not believe my
eyes. I turned to the others, and knew by their faces that
they and Arnold had seen it, too, and that Seth Upham
had not.</p>

<p>Then Gleazen, who was looking hard at Matterson, said
with an oath, "The beer is spilt. It's up the river for us."</p>

<p>And Matterson nodded.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>In that canoe, which had already swiftly and silently
disappeared among the mangroves, I had seen a white girl.</p>

<p>I cannot describe her to you now as she then appeared
in the canoe, sitting in front of the great, black canoeman.
It was long ago, and even at the time I was so startled, so
amazed, that I saw only her white face and great dark
eyes looking out at me from the shadowy recesses of the
swamp.</p>

<p>I felt as if I had been set down suddenly in the midst of
a fairy story. I strove against a sense of mystery and
danger, a thousand vague terrors.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you what the girl looked like; yet, though
I seem to deal in contradictions, I have never forgotten
that white frightened face and those dark eyes, which
had disappeared as mysteriously as they had come.</p>

<p>Then, as the sails filled and the Adventure fell off and
got steerage-way and slipped up the great, swift river,
Matterson spun the wheel with his own hands this way
and that.</p>

<p>At first the shores were low and sedgy and covered
deeply with mangroves; but soon the river widened into a
vast mirror, in which we saw reflected towering trees of
numberless varieties, with a trailing network of vines and
flowers, and from among the leaves, which were unbelievably
large, spears of bamboo and cane protruded. As
the wind at our backs drove us slowly up stream, notwithstanding
the swifter current where we passed through the
narrows, we saw plantains, bananas, oranges, lemons, and
tall palms. Then between the trunks we saw fields of rice;
and then, as we turned a bend where the river once more
widened, we saw a settlement before us.</p>

<p>In the centre of a clearing stood low houses built of cane
and thatched with grass, mud huts grouped here and
there, and a large enclosure for some purpose of which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
was ignorant. Could the girl I had seen in the swamp have
come thither? On all sides people were running this way
and that, some of them white, but most of them as black
as midnight. So small did the settlement appear, and so
sharply was each figure outlined, that it looked for all the
world like a toy village in a shop window, or like such a
tiny model of a foreign town as sailors sometimes bring
home from distant ports.</p>

<p>As the anchor gripped the bed of the river, and the men,
spraddling out on the footropes and leaning over the yards,
clewed up the sails and hauled in the great folds of canvas,
the Adventure brought up on her cable and lay with
her head into the current.</p>

<p>Matterson and Gleazen who had ordered a boat
launched and were standing in the gangway, now turned
and called to Uncle Seth, who responded by walking toward
them with as haughty a manner as if he were heart and
soul in their councils and their plans. All three of them
got into the boat and there talked for a while in undertones.
Then they called Willie MacDougald to come
tumbling after them, and all together they hastily went
ashore, where I saw that a crowd had gathered to meet
them; then the storm, which had so long been threatening,
broke with a roar of wind and rain, and Arnold and I,
going below, had the cabin for a time to ourselves.</p>

<p>Arnold sat down by the cabin table and looked around
at ports and doors, and at the dueling swords on the bulkhead,
and up at the skylight on which the storm was
fiercely beating.</p>

<p>"You, too," he said, with a quiet smile, "you, too, Joe,
look around at the cabin of this good brig. It has not
been a pleasant place to live, but I do believe there are
times coming when we shall wish ourselves back again in
this very spot."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what have you learned now of our friends' plans?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"One does not have to learn so much, Joe."</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>Arnold, I knew, was smiling at my impatience, although
the light was so nearly gone that I saw him, when he bent
forward, only as a deeper shadow in the darkness. Yet the
ports and the skylight still were clear enough to be reflected
in his eyes when he leaned very close to me, and
whatever his doubts, I saw that he showed no sign of fear.</p>

<p>"They talked yesterday and to-day&mdash;in Spanish&mdash;of
the men they call Bud and Bull, who share the secret that
has brought us all the way from Top&mdash;Hark!"</p>

<p>Arnold half rose. I myself heard a soft step. When Arnold
lifted his hand I saw his knife, now drawn, so far as I
knew, for the first time in apprehension of treachery.
Then the step&mdash;so soft and low&mdash;sounded again. I
reached for my own pistol. The sound was repeated yet
again. It was just outside the door. Then into the cabin
crept a low ambling creature, which we both knew at once
must be Pedro's monkey.</p>

<p>Arnold laughed quietly and sat down again and breathed
deeply.</p>

<p>"They have discovered&mdash;something," he whispered, as
if we had suffered no interruption.</p>

<p>"That I know well," I said. "But what?" I believed
that I, too, had ferreted out the secret, but I was not yet
willing to hazard my surmises.</p>

<p>"Sh!" He raised his hand to warn me. "Do you not
guess?" he whispered. "Try! Until they have got what
they have found to the sea, you and I are safe. They must
have men to help them who will not turn and rob them.
They do not believe in the saying about honor among
thieves."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come," I cried, "stop speaking in riddles. Tell me!"
Then, thinking of Cornelius Gleazen as I first had seen
him, with the rings flashing on his fingers, I popped out a
word that began with D.</p>

<p>Arnold smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," I returned, "speak up and tell me if such a voyage
as we have come upon is not a far-fetched manner of
approaching such an errand as you have described."</p>

<p>"In a sense, yes. In a sense, no. They are after other
things, too. This good vessel, as we have remarked before,
is well found for the trade."</p>

<p>Suddenly, he gave me a start by beginning to whistle a
lively tune and to drum on the table. His quick ear had
detected another step in the companionway. As the step
drew near, the monkey, which in our absorption we had
quite forgotten, pattered toward the door and slipped out.</p>

<p>"What's that? Who's here? Who passed me then?"
It was Captain North.</p>

<p>Arnold struck a spark into tinder and lighted a candle.</p>

<p>"And what, pray, are you two doing here in the dark?"
the captain demanded.</p>

<p>"We are passing time with talk of our good friends,
Gleazen and Matterson," said Arnold.</p>

<p>With an angry exclamation, Captain North took the
chair opposite us.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "matters have turned out as any sane
man might have known they would. That precious little
scamp of a cabin boy will tell you no more tales, Lamont."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll wager half my wages for the voyage that you and
I have seen the last of him. The monkey betrayed the
little scamp after all."</p>

<p>Although I knew that Willie MacDougald's innocent
and childlike face masked a scheming, rascally mind, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
could not so calmly see the little fellow go, soul and body,
into the power of such men as Gleazen and Matterson, or
perhaps worse; and although neither Arnold nor Gideon
North, appraising Willie at his true worth, cared a straw
what became of him, I was so troubled by his probable
fate that I did not listen to the others, who were talking
coolly enough about our own predicament, but, instead,
got up and walked around the cabin.</p>

<p>It seemed very strange to listen to the roaring wind
and driving rain and yet feel the brig lying quiet underfoot
in the strong, deep current of the river. Now I sat
down and listened to a few sentences of their talk; now I
got up and once more paced the cabin. For a while I
thought about Willie MacDougald; then I thought of the
dangers that surrounded us all, and of poor Uncle Seth,
once so bold and arrogant, now become little better than a
cowardly, pitiful wretch; then I thought of the girl I had
seen in the jungle, and strangely enough the memory of
her face seemed at once to quiet my wilder fancies and to
enable me to think more clearly than before.</p>

<p>Becoming aware at last that the storm was passing, I
went on deck and saw lights in the clearing where the
houses stood. The wind, which had come upon us so suddenly
and so fiercely, was subsiding as suddenly as it had
arisen, and a deep calm pervaded river, clearing, and jungle.
I had not waited ten minutes before I heard the boat
on the water.</p>

<p>"I swear," I heard Gleazen say in an angry, excited
voice, "I swear they're lying to us. Bud'll tell us. News
travels fast hereabouts. Bud'll be here soon."</p>

<p>They came on board, one at a time, all but Willie MacDougald.
Of him there was neither sign nor word. I
started forward to question them, then stopped short.
Something in their attitude froze and repelled me. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
what use were questions&mdash;then, at any rate? For a moment
they waited in the gangway, then, all together, they
went aft.</p>

<p>Leaving them and moving to the farther side of the brig,
I looked a long time into the dark, tangled jungle. The
clouds had gone and the stars had come out and the dying
wind spoke only in slow, distant soughs among the leaves.
So blackly repellent was the matted and decaying vegetation,
through which dark veins of stagnant water ran, and
so grimly silent, that I could not keep from shuddering
with a sort of childish horror. Surely, I thought, human
beings could not penetrate such depths. Then, almost
with my thought, there came across the dark and fever-laden
waters of the great swamp, out of the black jungle
night, a thread of golden melody. Someone in that very
jungle was whistling sweetly an old and plaintive tune.</p>

<p>I heard the three, Gleazen, Matterson, and my uncle,
turn to listen. By lantern light I saw their faces as they
looked intently toward the jungle. So still had the brig
now become, that I actually heard them breath more
quickly.</p>

<p>Then Neil Gleazen cried, "By the Holy, that's either
Bud O'Hara or his ghost."</p>

<p>With both hands cupped round his mouth, he was about
to send a hoarse reply roaring back across the river, when
Matterson clutched his hand.</p>

<p>"Be still," he whispered. "Here's the answer."</p>

<p>And he, in turn, sent back the answering phrase of that
singularly mournful and haunting ballad: "I Lost my Love
in the Nightingale."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="small">THE MAN FROM THE JUNGLE</span></h3>

<p>Very slowly Matterson whistled that old tune, "The
Nightingale," and very slowly an answer came back to us;
then a long silence ensued. The black water of the marsh
rose and fell. We could hear it whispering softly as it
washed against the tangled roots of the mangroves, and
once in a while I could distinguish the long, faint rasp of
some branch or vine that dragged across another. But except
for those small noises, the place was as still as a house
of death; and as we watched and waited, the feeling grew
upon me that we must be in the midst of a dream.</p>

<p>Then something moved and caught my eye, and a canoe
silently shot out upon the river. With a swish and swirl of
paddles, she came alongside us and stayed for a moment,
like a dragon-fly pausing in its flight, then shot silently
back the way she had come. I had seen against the water
that there were three men in the canoe when she came; but
when she slipped back into the mangroves, I saw that there
were only two.</p>

<p>Before I had time to question the reason of all this, I
saw a man's head rise above the bulwark and knew that he
had sprung from the canoe to the chains while the little
craft so briefly paused.</p>

<p>Climbing over the bulwark and dropping to the deck,
the man said in low, cautious voice, "Is it Neil I've been
hearing? And Molly?"</p>

<p>"Here we be, Bud, us two and Seth Upham."</p>

<p>"And sure, do this fine vessel be ours, Neil?"</p>

<p>"Ours she is, along with Seth Upham. Come, Bud, here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
is Mr. Upham, who has joined in with us and gets a half-and-half
lay, and here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Neil," the mysterious newcomer drawled, "would he
be comin' for naught short of half shares? And where's
Molly? Ah, Molly, you've been long away."</p>

<p>They all were shaking hands together.</p>

<p>"And now," said Matterson, "what news of Bull?"</p>

<p>"Of Bull, is it?" the man replied. "Sure, he's sitting on
the chest o' treasure. Warnings they give us, that the hill
is haunted and all such. Spirits, you know, Neil; spirits,
Molly. Sure the niggers know more about them things
than we do&mdash;indeed they do. It's not I would go agin
them rashly. But I fixed 'em, lads."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Matterson softly.</p>

<p>"Bull laughed at them fit to kill,&mdash;which is his way, as
you'll remember,&mdash;but not I. Says I, 'Laugh if you will;
't is well to be fearless since you're the one to stay.' But
I did for him better than the stiff-necked rascal would do
for himself. That night I hunted me out an old master
wizard and paid him in gold, and didn't he give me a
charm that will keep spirits away?"</p>

<p>To hear a sober white man talk of charms with all the
faith of a credulous child amazed me. I had never dreamed
there could be such a man. Pressing closer, I took a good
look at this queer stranger, and saw him to be a short,
broad fellow, with a square jaw and a face so intelligent
that my amazement became even greater.</p>

<p>He, in turn, saw me looking at him, and half in a drawl,
half in a brogue, asked, "Now who'll this one be?"</p>

<p>"He's the young man that came with Mr. Upham,"
Gleazen replied.</p>

<p>"Is he fearless?" asked the strange Bud. "And is he
honest?&mdash;Aye," he rather testily added, "and is he, too,
to share half-and-half?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>To that Gleazen returned no answer, but the man's tone
made me think of Gleazen himself roaring drunk and staggering
away from Higgleby's barn, of Matterson with his
voice hardened to a cutting edge, of the master of the
Merry Jack and Eleanor, and of the adventurous night
when we parted from poor Sim Muzzy. I tell you honestly,
I would have given every cent I had in the world
and every chance I had of fortune to have been fifteen
hundred leagues away.</p>

<p>Turning to Matterson, the man went on: "'T is not
discreet for the like o' you two to come sailing in by broad
daylight with all sail set. Now why couldn't ye ha' come
in a boat, say, and let the brig lie off the coast. Then we
could 'a' met secret-like and 'a' got away and up the river
with no one the wiser. Sure, and there's not a soul in a
thousand miles, now, that ain't heard a tale o' Neil and
Molly."</p>

<p>"The storm was hard upon us," said Matterson.</p>

<p>"And a cruiser lay in the offing," said Gleazen.</p>

<p>"It would be possible, then," the man returned, "that
ye're not as big&mdash;not <i>quite</i> as big fools as I took ye to be."</p>

<p>Then, as if all had been arranged beforehand, while Matterson
and the strange man and Uncle Seth went below to
the cabin, Gleazen took me by the arm and led me away
from the others.</p>

<p>"Joe," he murmured,&mdash;and I saw a new, eager glint in
his eyes,&mdash;"Joe, there's great times coming. I've made
up my mind I can trust you, Joe, and I'm going to make
you my lieutenant. Yes, sir, I'm going to make you an
officer."</p>

<p>I wondered what kind of story he would tell next, for
by this time I knew him far too intimately to be deceived
by his brazen flattery. It was singularly trying for me,
man grown that I was, to be treated with an air of patronage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that a stripling would have resented, and there were
moments when I was like to have turned on Gleazen with
a vengeance. But I waited my time. It was not hard to
see that my patience need not endure interminably.</p>

<p>"You, Joe, are one of us," he continued, "and we're
glad to take you into our confidence. But these others&mdash;"
he waved his hand generally&mdash;"we can't have 'em know
too much. Now we're going to-night to get things sized
up and ready, and what I want to know, Joe, is this: will
you&mdash;as my lieutenant, you understand&mdash;take Arnold
and Mr. Severance and Captain North ashore to call on
Mr. Parmenter?"</p>

<p>"But who," I asked, "is Mr. Parmenter?"</p>

<p>"He's an Englishman, Joe, and if you can sort of convey
to him&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;that we're after
hides and ivory, purely a matter of trade, it'll be a good
thing, Joe. Mind you, as my lieutenant, Joe."</p>

<p>Never had I been so <i>Joe'd</i> in all my life before. When
Gleazen had gone, I fairly snorted at my sudden and easy
honors. Evidently he told much the same story to the
others, except Captain North, with whom Gleazen himself
very well knew that such a flimsy yarn was not likely
to prevail, and to whom Uncle Seth, accordingly, entrusted
some genuine business; and half an hour later we
gathered at the rail to go ashore.</p>

<p>"Now, then," Captain North said peremptorily, in such
a way that I knew he was entirely unaware of my recent
appointment as Gleazen's lieutenant, "now then, lads,
into the boat all hands together."</p>

<p>"One moment!" I cried. "I forgot something." And
with that I ran back.</p>

<p>In changing my jacket in honor of the call we were to
make, I had left my pistol behind me. Of no mind to put
off without it, I hurried down to my stateroom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing through the cabin, I saw that the four men,
Gleazen, Matterson, the strange Bud, and my uncle, were
drawing up around the great table, on which they had carelessly
thrown a pack of cards. They gave me frowns and
hard looks as I passed, and I heard them muttering among
themselves at the interruption; but with scarcely a thought
of what they said, I left them to their game.</p>

<p>No sooner had our boat crunched on the shore than on
all sides black figures appeared from the darkness, and
landing, we found ourselves surrounded by negroes, who
pressed upon us until we fairly had to thrust them back
with oars. It was the first time I had set foot on the continent
of Africa, and the place and the people and the circumstances
were all, to my New England apprehension,
so extraordinary and so alarming that I cast a reluctant
glance back at the dim lights of the Adventure. But now
a door opened, and I saw in the bright rectangle a white
man in European clothes; and we went up and shook
his hand,&mdash;which seemed for some reason to displease
him, although he did not actually refuse it,&mdash;and were
ushered into a large room with a board floor and chairs
and tables and pictures, for all the world as if it were a
regular house.</p>

<p>"Under some circumstances I should no doubt be glad
to meet you, gentlemen," he said, with cold reserve, "for
no ship has visited us for more than three months. But we
hereabouts are not friendly to slavers."</p>

<p>"Nor are we," Gideon North retorted.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," said Arnold Lamont, soberly and precisely,
"that you mistake our errand."</p>

<p>He looked at us a long time without saying more, then
he quietly remarked, "I hope so."</p>

<p>His cold, measured words repelled us and set us at an
infinite distance from him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>We looked at one another and then at him, and he in
turn studied us.</p>

<p>We four&mdash;for Mr. Severance had accompanied us, although
as usual he scarcely opened his mouth&mdash;saw a
man whose iron-gray hair indicated that he was a little
beyond middle age. The lamp that burned beside him
revealed a strong, rather sad face; the book at his elbow
was a Bible. It came to me suddenly that he was a missionary.</p>

<p>"You give us chill welcome, sir," said Gideon North.
"What, then, will you have us do to prove that we are not
what you believe us?"</p>

<p>"Your leaders who were here a little while ago," our
host replied, "tried their best to prove it&mdash;and failed.
Indeed, had I not seen them, I should more readily believe
you. It is not the first time that I have seen some of them,
you must remember,"</p>

<p>Gideon North bit his lip. "Have you considered," he
asked, "that we may not be in accord with them?"</p>

<p>"A man must be known by the company he keeps."</p>

<p>"We are in <i>neither</i> sympathy nor accord with them."</p>

<p>"It is a virtue, sir, no matter what your circumstances,
to be at least loyal to your associates. If you so glibly repudiate
your friends, on what grounds should a stranger
trust you?"</p>

<p>At that Gideon North got up all hot with temper.
"Sir," he cried, "I will not stay to be insulted."</p>

<p>"Sir," the man returned, "I have insulted, and would
insult, no one."</p>

<p>"Of that, sir," Gideon North responded, "I will be my
own judge."</p>

<p>"Captain North," said Arnold, "have patience. One
moment and we&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning in the door, which he had reached in two
strides, our captain cried hotly, "Come, men, come! I tell
you, come!"</p>

<p>Mr. Severance followed him in silence; Arnold stepped
forward as if to restrain him, and I, left for a moment with
the missionary, turned and faced him with all the dignity
of which I was master.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that you think so ill of us," I said.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he replied, "to see a youth with an honest
face in such a band as that."</p>

<p>I could think of no response and was about to turn and
go, when I suddenly remembered our lost cabin boy.</p>

<p>"Can you, in any case," I asked, "tell me what has become
of our cabin boy, Willie MacDougald?"</p>

<p>"Of whom?"</p>

<p>"Of Willie MacDougald&mdash;the little fellow that came
ashore to-day?"</p>

<p>"Did he not return to the brig?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The man stepped forward.</p>

<p>"No," I repeated, "I have not seen him since."</p>

<p>"Then," he returned, "you are not likely ever to see
him again."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I demanded. "What has happened?
Where is he?"</p>

<p>Getting no answer, I looked around the room at the
chairs and tables and pictures,&mdash;they had an air of comfort
that made me miserably homesick,&mdash;and at the well-trimmed
lamp from which the light fell on the Bible. Then
I turned and went out into the darkness.</p>

<p>What had befallen that hardened little wretch? Where
under the canopy of heaven could he be? I cared little
enough for the mere fate of Willie MacDougald; but as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
new indication of the extremes to which Matterson and
Gleazen would go, his disappearance came at a time that
made it singularly ominous.</p>

<p>As I stood, thus pondering, on the rough porch from
which I was about to step down and stride into the darkness,
where I could make out the figures of negroes of all
ages moving restlessly just beyond the light that shone
from the windows, I received such a start as seldom has
come to me. A hand touched my arm so quietly that for a
moment I nearly had an illusion that that miserable little
sinner, Willie MacDougald, had returned from the next
world to haunt me in this one; a low voice said in my ear,
"Stay here with us."</p>

<p>I turned. Just beside me stood the girl whom I had seen
in the canoe.</p>

<p>"Stay here," she repeated. "They have gone."</p>

<p>I stammered and tried to speak, and for the first time
in my life I found that my tongue was tied.</p>

<p>A step rustled in the grass just under the porch; something
touched the floor beside my foot; then a huge black
hand brushed gently over my shoe and up my leg, and a
black, grotesque face, with rolling eyes and round, slightly
parted lips, looked up at me, so close to my hand that unconsciously
I snatched it away lest it be bitten.</p>

<p>Startled nearly out of my wits by this amazing apparition,
I gave a leap backward and crashed against the
wall, at which the absurd negro uttered a shrill whistle of
surprise.</p>

<p>The girl tossed her head and stamped her foot, and spoke
to the negro in a low voice, which yet was clear enough and
sharp enough to send him without a sound into the darkness.</p>

<p>For a moment the lights from the window shone full
upon her, and I saw that she was proud as well as comely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and spirited as well as generous. The toss and the stamp
showed it; the quick, precise voice confirmed it; and
withal there was a twinkle of kindliness in her eyes that
would have stormed the heart of a far more sophisticated
youth than I. Such spirit is little, if at all, less fascinating
to a young man than beauty; and when spirit and beauty
go hand in hand, he must be a crabbed old bachelor indeed
who can withstand the pair.</p>

<p>Whatever my theories of life, as I had long since revealed
them to Arnold Lamont, I was no Stoic; and though
at the time I was too excited to be fully aware of it, I
thereupon fell, to the crown of my head, in love.</p>

<p>As the negro vanished, she turned on me with that same,
queenly lift of her head.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, will you stay?"</p>

<p>"Why should I stay?" I managed at last to ask.</p>

<p>She looked me straight in the eye, "You're not of their
kind," she replied. "Father himself thinks that."</p>

<p>For the moment I was confused, and thought only of
Arnold and Gideon North.</p>

<p>"You and he are wrong," I stiffly responded. "I <i>am</i>
their kind, and I am proud to be their kind."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "oh! I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>A hurt look appeared in her eyes and she stepped back
and turned away.</p>

<p>All at once I remembered that she had never seen Arnold
and Gideon North; that she had not meant them at
all; that she had meant Gleazen and Matterson. It was
at the tip of my tongue to cry out to her, to call her back,
to tell her the whole truth about our party on board the
brig Adventure. I had drawn the very breath to speak,
when Gideon North's voice summoned me from the
darkness:</p>

<p>"Joe, Joe Woods! Where are you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here I am," I cried. "I am coming." Then, when I
turned to speak to the girl, I saw that she had gone.</p>

<p>I stepped off the porch, tripped, stumbled to my knees,
got up again, and strode so recklessly down through the
dark to the river that, before I knew I had reached it, I
was ankle-deep in water.</p>

<p>"Well, my man," cried Gideon North, "you seem to be
in a hurry now, though you were long enough starting."</p>

<p>Without a word, I got into the boat and took off my
shoes and poured out the water. It irritated me to see Arnold
looking at me keenly and yet with gentle amusement.
I had come to have no small respect for Arnold's unusual
insight.</p>

<p>All the way back to the brig my head was in such a
whirl that, for the first time in my waking moments since
we left Cuba, I completely forgot the one fundamental
object for which we three were working, to save as far as
possible poor Seth Upham and his property from the hands
of Cornelius Gleazen and his fellows. Instead I kept hearing
the voice that had said, "You're not of their kind,"
kept seeing the face that I had seen there in the dim light&mdash;not
at all clearly, yet clearly enough to see that it had
a sweet dignity and that it was good to look upon.</p>

<p>The boat bumping against the brig woke me from my
dreams. Scrambling aboard, I left my shoes in the galley
to dry by the stove and ran aft in my stocking feet, and
down below. In my eagerness to get dry shoes and stockings
I quite outstripped the others, who were loitering in
the gangway.</p>

<p>It was with no thought or intention of surprising the
four men in the cabin that I burst in upon them on my
way to my own stateroom. They had pushed cards and
chips to one side of the table and had gathered closely
round it. In the centre, where their four heads almost met,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
was a handful of rough stones, which for all I knew might
have been quartz.</p>

<p>That I had done anything to anger them, when I came
down so unceremoniously, I was entirely unaware; but
O'Hara, the newcomer, sweeping the stones together with
a curse, covered them with his hands; Gleazen faced about
and angrily stared at my stockinged feet; and Matterson,
rising in fury, snarled through his teeth, "You sniveling,
sneaking, prying son of a skulking sea-cook, I swear I'll
have your heart's blood!"</p>

<p>Before I could turn, the man dived at me straight across
the table. I raised my hands to fend him off, with the intention
of shoving his head into the floor and planting my
feet on the back of his neck; stepped back, tripped and
fell. I saw Gleazen lift a chair to bring it down on my
head&mdash;even then I thought of the irony of my being his
"lieutenant"! I saw that wild Irishman, Bud O'Hara,
laughing like a fiend at my plight. Then I flung up my
feet to receive the blow, and seizing the legs of the chair,
twisted it over between Matterson and myself, and got
up on my knees. Then in came the others.</p>

<p>Spinning on his heel, Matterson, his jaw out-thrust,
stood squarely in the path of Gideon North.</p>

<p>"You are hasty," I said. "I came in to get my shoes."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Bud O'Hara, in biting sarcasm, "and
then 't was in the eyes of us that you was looking for
trouble."</p>

<p>"It was, indeed," I retorted.</p>

<p>"And perhaps you didn't see what was going on," he
persisted.</p>

<p>"I did not," I replied, not knowing what he meant.</p>

<p>They looked doubtfully at one another, and then at me,
and presently Gleazen said, "Then we're sorry we used
you rough, Joe."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I now perceived, the handful of stones had
disappeared.</p>

<p>All this time my uncle had sat in his chair, looking like
a man in a nightmare, and had raised neither hand nor
voice to help me. In a way, so amazing was his silence, it
seemed almost as if he himself had struck me. I could
scarcely believe it of him. When I looked at him in mingled
wonder and grief, his eyes fell and he slightly moistened
his lips.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="small">A WARNING DEFIED</span></h3>

<p>The brig Adventure, two thousand miles from home,
lay now in the strong, silent current of a great tropical
river, which seemed to me to have an almost human quality.
In its depth and strength and silence, it was like a
determined, taciturn man. I felt keenly its subtle fascination;
I delighted to picture in my mind its course all the
way from the mysterious hills far inland, of which Pedro
and Gleazen and Matterson told stories filled with trade
and slaves and stirring incidents, down to the low, marshy
shore, which had already cast a spell upon me.</p>

<p>For months since that fearful night when we five fled
from Topham, Arnold and Gideon North and I had been
holding ourselves ready at every moment to stand up
against Gleazen and Matterson and meet them man to
man in behalf of my poor, deluded uncle, who now would
go slinking about the deck, now would make a pitiful show
of his old pompous, dictatorial manner. But when I burst
in upon them in the cabin, there had been that in their
manner, even after their anger spent itself, which told me
more plainly than harshest words that the time for action
had come very near.</p>

<p>To Arnold, when we were alone in our stateroom, I said,
"What would you think, were I to load my pistols afresh?"</p>

<p>He looked curiously at me.</p>

<p>"You think," said he, slowly, "that there is already
need?"</p>

<p>"I do," I replied.</p>

<p>I felt a new confidence in myself and in my own judgment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
I regarded our situation calmly and with growing
assurance. Although I did not then realize it, I know now
that I was crossing the threshold between youth and manhood.</p>

<p>He gravely nodded.</p>

<p>"It is a wise precaution," he said at last, "although I
prophesy that they will use us further before the time
comes when we must fight for our lives."</p>

<p>So we both slept that night with new charges in the pistols
by our heads, and Arnold, very likely, as well as I,
dreamed of the utterly reckless, lawless men with whom
we were associated. I question, though, if Arnold thought
as much as I of the stern man in the cane house on the
riverbank, or if he thought at all of the girl whose white
face and dark eyes I could not forget.</p>

<p>For another day we continued to lie in the river; but
the brig, alow and aloft, bustled with various activities.
We sorted out firearms on the cabin floor, and charts and
maps on the cabin table, and on the spar-deck we piled a
large store of provisions. And in the afternoon Matterson
took Captain North in the quarter boat down to the
mouth of the river, and there taught him the bearings of
the channel.</p>

<p>Side by side Arnold and I watched all that went forward,
here lending a hand at whatever task came our way,
there noting keenly how the stores were arranged.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Arnold, quietly, when Captain North
for a moment stood beside us in preoccupied silence, "are
we about to load a cargo of Africans?"</p>

<p>"I assure you I'd like to know that," the captain replied,
with one of his quick glances.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth gave me an occasional curt word or sentence&mdash;he
was in one of his arrogant moods; Matterson talked
to me vaguely and at length of great times ahead; O'Hara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
watched me with hostile and suspicious glances. And still
Arnold and I, whenever occasion offered, put our heads together
and made what we could of the various preparations.
Our surmises, time showed, were not far wrong.</p>

<p>And all this while I had watched the clearing ashore and
had seen neither the missionary nor any other white man.</p>

<p>When, in the evening, all hands were ordered aft, we on
the quarter deck looked down and saw the men standing
expectantly to hear whatever was to be said. A thousand
rumors had spread throughout the vessel, and of what
was really afoot they knew less, even, than Arnold and I.
There was Abe Guptil with his kindly face upturned,
Pedro with his monkey on his shoulder and what seemed
to me a devilish gleam in his eye, and all the rest. As they
gathered close under us, the light from the lanterns slung in
the rigging revealed every one of them to my curious gaze.</p>

<p>"Men," said Captain North, quietly, "Mr. Gleazen has
asked me to call you together. There are certain things
that he wishes to tell you."</p>

<p>As the grizzled old mariner stepped back, Cornelius
Gleazen advanced.</p>

<p>His beaver, donned for the occasion, was tilted over his
eye as of old; his diamonds flashed from finger and throat;
he puffed great clouds of smoke from his ever-present
cigar.</p>

<p>"Lads," he cried in that voice which seemed always so
fine and hearty and honest, "lads, that there's no ordinary
purpose in this voyage, all of you, I make no doubt,
have heard. Well, lads, you're right about that. It is no
ordinary purpose that has brought us all the way from
Boston. You've done good work for us so far, and if you
keep up the good work until the end of the voyage has
brought us home again to New England, we ain't going to
forget you, lads. No, sir! Not me and Mr. Matterson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Mr. O'Hara&mdash;oh, yes, and Mr. Upham! We ain't going
to forget you."</p>

<p>Reflectively he knocked the ash from his cigar. Leaning
over the rail, he said, as if taking all the men into his confidence,
"All you've got to do now, lads, is stand by.
Captain North will take the brig to sea for one week.
There's a reason for that, lads, a good reason. At the end
of the week he will bring the brig up off the mouth of the
river, and some fine morning you'll wake up and find us
back again.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, lads, we're going to make up a little party
to go exploring. Me and Mr. Matterson, Mr. O'Hara, Mr.
Upham, and Pedro and Sanchez are going. And we are
going to take John Laughlin with us, too. It's going to be
a hard trip, lads, and you'll none of you be sorry to miss it.
Now, then, lay to and load this gear into the boat. Be
faithful to your work, and you'll be glad when you see
what we're going to do for you."</p>

<p>As he turned away, proud of his eloquence, there was a
low rumble of voices.</p>

<p>I looked first at Gleazen and Matterson and O'Hara;
then I looked at poor Seth Upham, once as proud and arrogant
as any of them. Remembering how in little ways he
had been kind to me,&mdash;how, since my mother died, his
dry, hard affection had gone out to me, as if in spite of
him,&mdash;I pitied the man from the bottom of my heart.
Surely, I thought, he must not go alone into the wilds of
Africa with such men as were to make up Gleazen's party.</p>

<p>No one had spoken, except in undertones, since Gleazen;
some one, I thought, must speak promptly and firmly.</p>

<p>For a moment, as I looked at the hard faces of the men
whom I must oppose, my courage forsook me utterly; then
the new confidence that had been growing within me once
more gave me command of myself. Whatever should come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of my effort, I was determined that my mother's brother
should have at least one honest man beside him. To reason
out all this had taken me the merest fraction of the
time that it takes to read it.</p>

<p>Stepping suddenly forward, I said in a voice so decided
that it surprised me as much as anyone, if not more:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleazen, I desire to go with you."</p>

<p>"And I," said Arnold Lamont.</p>

<p>"You young pup," Gleazen bellowed, "who are you to
desire this or desire that?"</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "I <i>will</i> go with you."</p>

<p>"You will not," he retorted.</p>

<p>I saw out of the corner of my eye that Matterson and
O'Hara were looking at me keenly, but I never let my
gaze veer from Gleazen's.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleazen," I said boldly, "Arnold Lamont, Abe
Guptil, and I are going to take the places of Pedro, Sanchez,
and John Laughlin."</p>

<p>He swore a round oath and stepped toward me with his
fists clenched, while the men below us fairly held their
breath. In a fist fight the man could have pounded me to
a pulp, for he was half as heavy again as I; but at the
thought of poor Uncle Seth with all his property tied up
in that mad venture, with his happiness and his very life
in the absolute power of that band of godless reprobates,
something stronger than myself rose up within me. At
that moment I verily believe I could have faced the fires
of hell without flinching. Thinking of the old days when
Uncle Seth and my mother and I had been so happy together
and of how kind he had been to me in his own
testy, abrupt, reserved way, I stepped out and shook my
fist in Gleazen's face.</p>

<p>Before he could say another word, I cried, "So help me,
unless we three go with you and those three stay, we'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
keep Seth Upham back and sail away in the Adventure
and leave you here forever."</p>

<p>Never before could I have spoken thus lightly of what
my uncle should, or should not, do. The thought made me
feel even more keenly how helpless the poor man had become,
and confirmed me in my purpose.</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to add that Gideon
North was to come, too, but I thought of how essential it
was that someone whom we&mdash;Arnold and I&mdash;could
trust should stand guard upon the brig, and said nothing
more, which probably was better, for my words seemed to
have struck home.</p>

<p>When I threatened to sail away with the Adventure,
Gleazen glared at me hard and murmured, with a respect
and admiration in his voice that surprised me, "You
young cock, I didn't think you had it in you."</p>

<p>Throwing overboard the butt of his cigar, which made
a bright arc in its flight through the darkness and fell into
the water with a smart hiss, he smiled to himself.</p>

<p>Matterson whispered to O'Hara, who touched Gleazen's
arm. I thought I heard him say, "Too honest to make
trouble," as they drew apart and conferred together,
glancing now and then at my uncle; then Gleazen nodded
and said, "Very well, Joe"; and I knew that for once I had
come off victorious.</p>

<p>At least, I thought, we are strong enough to stand up
for our rights and Uncle Seth's.</p>

<p>The men quietly turned away and went forward, a little
disappointed that the trouble had blown past and the episode
had come to naught. But it had added one more issue
to be fought out between Cornelius Gleazen and myself;
and though it was over, it was neither forgotten nor forgiven.</p>

<p>I had gone into the waist, where I was watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
arms and provisions that the men were loading into the
boat we were to take, when I heard a voice at my ear, "I
guess&mdash;ha-ha!&mdash;you come back with plenty nigger,
hey?"</p>

<p>It was Pedro with his monkey riding on his shoulder.
The beast leered at me and clicked its teeth.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "of that I am sure. We are not going
after any such cargo as that."</p>

<p>"I wonder," he responded. "I t'ink, hey, queer way to
get nigger&mdash;no barracoon&mdash;go in a boat. But dah
plenty nigger food below. Plenty lumber. Plenty chain'.
What you get if not nigger?"</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Maybe so&mdash;maybe not," Pedro muttered. His earrings
tinkled as he shook his head and moved away.</p>

<p>I was surprised to observe that for the moment all work
had stopped.</p>

<p>Seeing that O'Hara was pointing into the swamp, I
stepped over beside him to ascertain what had caught
his attention, but found the darkness impenetrable.</p>

<p>"I'm telling ye, some one's there," O'Hara muttered
with an oath.</p>

<p>I saw that Gleazen and Matterson were on the other
side of him.</p>

<p>Now the men were whispering.</p>

<p>"Sh!"</p>

<p>"See there&mdash;there&mdash;there it goes!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;Oh! There it is!"</p>

<p>I myself saw that something vague and shadowy was
moving indistinctly toward us down one of the long lanes
of water.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the swamp came a piercing wail. It
was so utterly unhuman that to every one of us it brought,
I believe, a nameless terror. Certainly I can answer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
myself. It was as if some creature from another world had
suddenly found a voice and were crying out to us. Then
the wail was repeated, and then, as if revealed by some
preparation of phosphorus, I indistinctly saw, in the dark
of the swamp, an uncouth face, black as midnight, on which
were painted white rings and patches.</p>

<p>For the third time the cry came out to us; then a voice
shrieked in a queer, wailing minor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"White man, I come 'peak. Long time past white man
go up water. Him t'ief from king spirit. Him go Dead
Land.</p>

<p>"White man, I come 'peak. We no sell slave. White
man go him country so him not go Dead Land. White
man, I go."</p>

<p>The dim, mysterious face drew away little by little and
disappeared. A single soft splash came from the great
marsh, then a yell so wild and weird that to this very day
the memory of it sometimes sets me to shivering, as if I
myself were only a heathen savage and not a white man
and a Christian.</p>

<p>Three times we heard the wild yell; then far off in the
fastnesses of the swamp, we heard an unholy chanting.
It was high and shrill and piercing, and it brought to us
across the dark water suggestions of a thousand terrors.</p>

<p>I felt Bud O'Hara's hand on mine, and it was as cold

<p>"By Heaven!" O'Hara gasped, "the voice has spoke."</p>

<p>"Aye, so it has," said Gleazen slowly.</p>

<p>"Neil, Molly, sure and we'd best put out to sea. This
is no time for us, surely. A month from now, say, we
could slip in by night with a boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O'Hara," said Matterson's light, almost silvery voice,
"have <i>you</i> turned coward?"</p>

<p>"No, not that, Molly! 'T is not I am scairt of any man
that walks the green earth, Molly, but spirits is different."</p>

<p>"Spirits!" Matterson was softly laughing. "I didn't
think, O'Hara, <i>you'd</i> be one to turn black."</p>

<p>"Laugh, curse you!" O'Hara cried hotly. "If 'twas
you had seen a glimmer of the things I've seen with my
own two eyes; if 't was you had seen a man die because he
went against taboo; if 't was you had seen a witch doctor
bring the yammering spirit back unwilling to a cold body;
if 't was you had seen a man three weeks dead get up and
dance; if 't was you had seen a strong man fall down without
the breath of life in him at all, and all for nothing else
but a spell was on him, maybe then you'd believe me. I
swear by the blessed saints in heaven, it's throwing our
lives away to go up river now; and all I've got to say for
Bull is, God help him!"</p>

<p>The others were looking at O'Hara curiously. The lantern
light on their faces brought out every scar and wrinkle
and showed that strong passions were contending within
each of them.</p>

<p>"It ain't spirits that worries me," said Gleazen, at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
"and it ain't niggers. It's men." He now seemed quite to
shake off the spell of the strange voice. "What say,
Seth?" He turned to my uncle.</p>

<p>To my surprise, Seth Upham rose manfully to the occasion.
"Spirits?" he cried. "Nonsense!"</p>

<p>O'Hara uneasily shifted his feet. "Ah, say what you
like, men," he very earnestly replied, "say what you like
against spirits and greegrees and jujus and all the rest.
I'll never be one to say there's nothing in them, nor
would you, if you'd seen all that I have seen. And I'll be
telling you this, men: that voice we heard then was speaking
the thoughts of ten thousand fighting niggers up and
down this river."</p>

<p>"Pfaw!" said Gleazen, stretching his arms. "Niggers
won't fight."</p>

<p>"That from you, Neil!"</p>

<p>I never learned just what lay behind O'Hara's simple
thrust, but there was no doubt that it struck a weak link
in Gleazen's armor, for he flushed so deeply that we could
see it by lantern light. "Well, now," said he, with a conciliatory
inflection, "of course I meant it in moderation."</p>

<p>All this time Arnold and Gideon North and I stood by
and looked and listened.</p>

<p>Now, with a glance at us, Matterson said shortly,
"Come, come! Enough of that. All hands lay to and
load the boat."</p>

<p>"I've warned ye," said O'Hara.</p>

<p>"At midnight," said Matterson, "<i>we'll</i> go <i>up</i> the river,
and Gideon North'll take the brig <i>down</i> the river. Come
morning there'll be no stick nor timber of us here. They'll
bother no more about us then."</p>

<p>"Ye'll never fool 'em," said O'Hara.</p>

<p>Matterson turned his back on him, and the work went
forward, and for an hour there was only the low murmur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of voices. The boat, now ready for the journey, rode at
the end of her painter, where the current made long ripples,
which converged at her bow. Here and there, lights shone
in the clearing and set my imagination and my memory
hard at work, but elsewhere the impenetrable blackness
of a cloudy night blanketed the whole world. And meanwhile
the others were holding council in the cabin.</p>

<p>"I think," Arnold Lamont said, "that Matterson and
Gleazen underestimate the ingenuity and resources of that
black yelling devil."</p>

<p>"So they do," said Abe Guptil. "So they do, and I'd
be glad enough to be back home, I tell you."</p>

<p>What would I not have given to be sleeping once more
in Abe's low-studded house beside our wholesome northern
sea!</p>

<p>Now the others came from the cabin. They walked
eagerly. Their very whispers were full of excitement.
Even Uncle Seth seemed to have got from somewhere a
new confidence and a new hope, so smartly did he step
about and so sharply did he speak; and the faint odor of
brandy that came with them explained much.</p>

<p>We climbed down into the loaded boat and settled ourselves
on the thwarts, where Abe Guptil and I took oars.</p>

<p>"It's turn and turn about at the rowing," Matterson
announced. "We've a long way to go and a current dead
against us."</p>

<p>I saw Gideon North looking down at us anxiously, and
waved my hand. Then someone cast off, and we pulled out
into midstream and up above the brig, where we held our
place and watched and waited.</p>

<p>Soon we heard orders on board the brig. Sails fell
from the gaskets and shook free. The men began to heave
at the windlass. The brig first came up to the anchors,
then, with anchors aweigh, she half turned in the current.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Now orders followed in quick succession. We could hear
them rigging the fish tackle and catching the hooks on the
flukes of the anchors. Blocks rattled, braces creaked, the
yards swung from side to side according to the word of
command. The sails filled with the light breeze, and coming
slowly about, the Adventure gathered steerage-way
and went down the river as if she were some gigantic water
bird lazily swimming between the mangroves. We watched
her go and knew that we seven were now irrevocably left
to fend for ourselves.</p>

<p>When Gleazen whispered to us to give way, we bent to
the oars with a will. For better or for worse, we had embarked
on the final stage of our great quest.</p>

<p>The lights in the clearing fell astern. The tall trees
seemed to close in above us. Alone in the wilderness, we
turned the bow of our boat toward the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>That we had set forth in complete secrecy on our voyage
up river we were absolutely confident. What eyes
were keen enough to tell at a distance that the brig had
left a boat behind her when she sailed?</p>

<p>Gleazen now laughed derisively at O'Hara. "You'd
have had us sail away, would you? And wait a month?
Or a year, maybe, or maybe two. Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Don't you laugh at me, Neil," O'Hara replied. "We're
not yet out o' the woods."</p>

<p>At the man's solemn manner Gleazen laughed again,
louder than before.</p>

<p>As if to reprove his rashness, as if to bear out every
word O'Hara had said, at that very moment the uncanny
yell we had heard before rose the second time, far off in the
swamp. Three times we heard the yell, then we heard the
voice, faint and far away, "White man, I come 'peak.
White man boat him sink. White man him go Dead Land."</p>

<p>Three times more the wordless wailing yell drifted to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
out of the darkness; then we heard a great multitude of
men wildly and savagely laughing.</p>

<p>Never again did Cornelius Gleazen scoff at O'Hara. His
face now, I verily believe, was grayer than O'Hara's. He
turned about and stared downstream as if he could see
beyond the black wall of mangroves.</p>

<p>"Now what'll we do?" he gasped, with a choking, profane
ejaculation. "Did you hear that?"</p>

<p>Had we heard it! There was not one of us whom it had
not chilled to the heart. Our own smallness under those
vast trees, our few resources,&mdash;we had only the goods
that were piled in the boat,&mdash;our unfathomable loneliness,
combined to make us feel utterly without help or
strength. But it was now too late to return. So we bent
to our oars and rowed on, and on, and on, against the current
of the great river.</p>

<p>The only help that remained to us lay in our own right
hands and in the mercy of divine Providence. Would
Providence, I wondered, help such men as Gleazen and
Matterson and O'Hara?</p>

<p>Nor was that the only doubt that beset us. Although
the three accepted us, and in actual fact trusted us, they
made no attempt to conceal their enmity; and I very well
knew that, besides danger from without our little band,
Arnold, Abe, and I must guard against treachery from
within it.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="small">UP STREAM</span></h3>

<p>Pulling hard at our oars, we rowed up the river, along
the shore and so near it that the shadows of the mangroves
almost concealed us. My breath came in quick,
hard gasps; the sweat started from my body and dripped
down my face; every muscle ached from violent exertion.
As I dizzily reeled, I saw, as if it were carved out of
wood or stone, Gleazen's staring, motionless face thrust
forth squarely in front of my own. Then I flopped forward
and Gleazen himself caught the oar from my hands.</p>

<p>We had taken the gig for our expedition, because it was
light and fast; but although we carried four oars, we used
only two of them, mainly because it had been Gleazen's
whim to load our baggage between the after thwarts, so
that while two men rowed for comparatively short spells,
the others could take their ease in bow and stern. And
indeed, had our plan to set forth with utmost secrecy
not gone awry, it would have been a comfortable enough
arrangement.</p>

<p>I had not dreamed that Gleazen was so strong; he set a
stroke that no ordinary oarsman could maintain; and
when Abe Guptil lost time and reeled on the thwart, Matterson
slipped into his place and fairly lifted the boat on
the water.</p>

<p>Of course we could not keep up such a pace for long; but
the hard work in a way relieved our anxiety, as hard work
does when one is troubled; and after each of us, including
Uncle Seth, had taken his turn at the oars until he was
dog-tired, we settled down to a saner, steadier stroke, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
thus began in earnest the long journey that was to be the
last stage of our pilgrimage.</p>

<p>By watching the gray lane overhead, where the arching
trees failed to meet above the river, since it was literally
too dark to see the water, we were able to mark out our
course; and skirting the tangled and interwoven roots as
nearly as we could, we doggedly fought our way against
the current to the monotonous rhythm of swinging oars,
loud breathing, and hoarse grunts. The constant whisper
of the river so lulled me, weary as I was, that by and by
my head drooped, and the next thing that I knew was a
hand on my shoulder and a voice at my ear calling me to
take my turn at rowing.</p>

<p>I woke slowly and saw that Abe Guptil like me was rubbing
his eyes, and that my uncle and Arnold Lamont were
lying fast asleep on the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Gleazen, quietly. "See, now! Mr.
Matterson and I've brought us well on our way. Come,
get up and row till it is fairly light. Wake us then, and
we'll haul the boat up and lie in hiding for the day."</p>

<p>Matterson handed over his oar without a word, and
Abe and I fell to our task.</p>

<p>As the dawn grew and widened in the east, we could see
how thickly the roots of the mangroves intertwined. From
the ends of the limbs small "hangers," like ropes, grew
down and took root in the ground. The trees, thus braced
and standing from six to twelve feet in air on their network
of tangled, interwoven roots, were the oddest I had
ever seen.</p>

<p>After a time we came to a large stretch of bush, where
innumerable small palms were crowded together so thickly
that among them an object would have been completely
invisible, even in broad day, at a distance of six feet. In
the midst of the bush a great tree grew, and in the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
it a band of monkeys was swinging and racing and chattering
in the pale light. In an undertone I spoke to Abe
about the monkeys, and he, too, still rowing, turned his
head to watch them. Then, at the very moment when we
were intent on their antics, a new mood seemed to come
over them.</p>

<p>I cannot well describe the change, because at first it was
so subtle that I felt it, as much as saw it, and I was inclined
to doubt if Abe would notice it at all. Yet as I
watched the little creatures, which had now ceased their
chattering, I suddenly realized that the boat was beginning
to drift with the current. By common impulse, attracted
by the very same thing, both Abe and I had
stopped rowing.</p>

<p>As I leaned forward and again swung out my oar, Abe
touched my arm. "Hush!" he whispered. "Wait!
Listen!"</p>

<p>Pausing with arms outstretched, ready to throw all my
strength into the catch, I listened and heard a faint <i>crack</i>,
as of a broken stick, under the tree in which a moment
since the monkeys had been hard at play.</p>

<p>We exchanged glances.</p>

<p>I now realized that daylight, coming with the swiftness
that is characteristic of it in the tropics, had taken us unawares.
The sun had risen and found Abe and me so intent
on a band of monkeys playing in a tree, that we had neglected
to wake the others.</p>

<p>I put out my hand and leaned over the bags to touch
Gleazen, the nearest of the sleepers, when Abe again
pressed my arm. Turning, I saw that his finger was at his
lips. Although his gesture puzzled me, I obeyed it, and
we remained silent for a minute or two while the current
carried the boat farther and farther downstream.</p>

<p>Every foot that we drifted back meant labor lost, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
I was so sorely tempted to put an end to our silence that
I was on the point of speaking out, when, distinctly, unmistakably,
we heard another crackle in the bush.</p>

<p>"Pull," Abe whispered, "pull, Joe, as hard as you can."</p>

<p>I leaned back against my oar, heard the water gurgle
from under it, saw bubbles go floating down past the
stern, and knew that by one stroke we had stopped our
drifting. With a second swing of the long blades, we sent
the boat once more up against the current. Now we got
back into the old rhythm and went on past the dense
palms, until we again came to the tangled roots of mangroves.</p>

<p>Laying hold of one of the roots, Abe whispered, "Wake
'em, Joe!"</p>

<p>They woke testily, and with no thanks to us, even
though it was by their orders that we called them.</p>

<p>In reply to their questions we told them the whole story,
from the strange hush that came over the monkeys to the
second crackling among the palms; but they appeared not
to take our apprehensions seriously.</p>

<p>"Belike it was a snake," said O'Hara, "a big feller,
Them big fellers will scare a monkey into fits."</p>

<p>"Or some kind of an animal," said Gleazen, curtly.
"Didn't I say we was to be called at daylight? When I
say a thing I mean it." He impatiently turned from us to
his intimates. "How about it, Bud; shall we haul up here
for the day?"</p>

<p>"Belike it was only a snake," O'Hara replied, "but
'twas near, despite of that. Push on, I say."</p>

<p>There was something in the expression of his face as he
stared downstream that made me even more uneasy than
before.</p>

<p>"Not so! The niggers will see us in the open and end us
there and then," interposed Matterson. "Moreover, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the place has changed with the times, there's a town
a scant three miles ahead."</p>

<p>"Belike 'twas only a serpent," O'Hara doggedly repeated,
"but 'tis no place for us here. Let us fare on just
half a mile up stream t'other side the river, in the mouth
of the little creek that makes in there, and, me lads, let us
get there quickly."</p>

<p>As we once more began to row, I was confident that
O'Hara's talk of a great serpent was poppy-cock for us
and for Uncle Seth, and that in any case neither Gleazen
nor Matterson nor O'Hara cared a straw about a serpent
half a mile away. At the time I would have given much to
know just what shrewd guess they had made at the cause
of that strange crackling; but they dismissed the subject
absolutely, which probably was as well for all concerned;
and refusing to speak of it again, they urged Abe and me
to our rowing until at their direction we bore across the
current and slipped through the trailing branches of the
trees, and through the thick bushes and dangling vines,
into the well-hidden mouth of a little creek.</p>

<p>By then the sun was shining hotly and I was glad
enough to lean on my oar and get my breath.</p>

<hr class="c65" />

<p>All that day we lay in the thick vegetation of the creek,
which to a certain extent shielded us from the sun, although
the warm, damp air became almost unendurable.
Much of the time we slept, but always one or another of
us was posted as a guard, and at high noon an alarm called
us to our weapons.</p>

<p>O'Hara, who happened to be standing watch, woke us
without a sound, one after another, by touching us with
his hand.</p>

<p>For a while we saw only the great trees, the sluggish
creek, the slow river, and the interwoven vines; then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
heard voices, and into our sight there swept a long canoe
manned by naked negroes, who swung their paddles
strongly and went racing past us down the river.</p>

<p>How, I wondered, had O'Hara known that they were
coming? Human ears could not have heard their voices
as far away as they must have been when he woke us.</p>

<p>It was evident, when the blacks had gone, that Matterson
and O'Hara had made sense of their mumbled gutteral
speech.</p>

<p>"I warned ye," O'Hara whispered, glaring at Matterson
and Gleazen. "Had we waited, now, say only a
month, they'd not be scouring the river in search of us."</p>

<p>"Pfaw! Niggers with bows and arrows," Gleazen scornfully
muttered.</p>

<p>"Yes, niggers with bows and arrows," O'Hara returned.
"But I'd no sooner die by an arrow than by a musket-ball."</p>

<p>"Die? Who's talking o' dying?" Gleazen whispered.
And calmly laying himself down again, he once more closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sure, and I'd not be one to talk o' dying," O'Hara
murmured, as he resumed his guard with a musket across
his knees, "was not the curse o' rash companions upon
me."</p>

<p>Matterson, holding aloof from their controversy, solemnly
looked from one of the two to the other. There was
that in his eyes which I did not like to see&mdash;not fear, certainly,
but a look of understanding, which convinced me
that O'Hara had the right of it.</p>

<p>And now Seth Upham, who had followed all this so
sleepily that he did not more than half understand the significance
of what had occurred, as of old spoke up sharply,
even pompously. In that confused state between sleeping
and waking his mind seemed to have gone back to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
mood of months before. "That's all nonsense, O'Hara;
we're safe enough. Gleazen's right." His words fairly
shattered the silence of the marshy woods.</p>

<p>He was the first of us to speak in an ordinarily loud
voice, and almost before he had finished his sentence a
bird about as big as a crow and as black as jet except for
its breast and neck, which were snowy white, rose from a
tree above us, and with a cry that to me sounded for all
the world like a crow cawing, circled high in the air.</p>

<p>Hot with anger, O'Hara struck Seth Upham on the
mouth with his open hand.</p>

<p>That it had been arrant folly for my uncle thus to speak
aloud, I knew as well as any other; and the bird circling
above us and crying out in its slow flight was liable to draw
upon us an attack from heaven only knew what source
and quarter. But that O'Hara or any other should openly
strike the man who in his own way had been so kind to
me was something that I could not endure, and my own
temper flamed up as hotly as ever did O'Hara's.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash I caught his wrist, even before he had
withdrawn his hand, and jerked him from the thwart to
his knees. With a devilish gleam in his eye, he threw off
my grip and clubbed his musket.</p>

<p>Before I could draw my pistol he would have brained
me, had not Matterson, with no desire whatever to save
me from such a fate, but apparently only eager to have a
hand in the affair, seized me from behind, lifted me bodily
from my seat, and plunged me down out of sight into the
creek.</p>

<p>Of what followed, I know only by hearsay, for I was too
much occupied with saving myself from drowning to observe
events in the boat. But the creek was comparatively
shallow, and getting my feet firmly planted on bottom, I
pushed up my head and breathed deeply.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile it seems that Arnold Lamont quietly thrust
his knife a quarter of an inch through the skin between
two of Matterson's ribs, thus effectually distracting his
attention, while Abe Guptil deftly caught O'Hara's
clubbed musket in his hands and wrenched it away.</p>

<p>As I hauled myself back into the boat, Gleazen sat up
and stared, first at the others who, now that Matterson
had knocked Arnold's knife to one side, were momentarily
deadlocked, then at me dripping from my plunge, then
at Seth Upham upon whose white face the marks of
O'Hara's hand still showed red.</p>

<p>"Between you," he whispered angrily, "you <i>will</i> have
half the niggers in Africa upon us."</p>

<p>"He talked," O'Hara muttered, pointing at Uncle Seth.</p>

<p>"You struck him," I retorted.</p>

<p>"'Twas a bird told me they was coming by. 'Twill
be that bird surely will tell them we are here."</p>

<p>Arnold and Abe and I glared angrily at O'Hara and Matterson
and Gleazen, but by common consent we dropped
the brief quarrel, and when, after an anxious time of waiting,
the canoe had not reappeared, we again lay down to
sleep.</p>

<p>Yet I saw that Uncle Seth's hand was trembling and
that he was not so calm as he tried to appear; and I knew
that, although we might go on with a semblance of tolerance,
even of friendship, the rift in our little party had
grown vastly wider.</p>

<p>Waking at nightfall, we made our evening meal of such
cooked provisions as we had brought from the Adventure,
and pushed through the screen of dense branches, and out
on the strongly running, silent river. Again we bent to the
oars and rowed interminably on against the stream and
into the black darkness.</p>

<p>That night we passed a town with wattled houses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
thatched roofs rising in tall cones high on the riverbank,
and a building that O'Hara said was a <i>barre</i> or courthouse.
In the town, we saw against the sky, which the rising
moon now lighted, a few orange trees and palms, and under
it, close beside the bank of the river, we indistinctly made
out a boat, which, Gleazen whispered, was very likely
loaded with camwood and ivory. We passed it in the shadow
of the opposite shore, rowing softly because we were
afraid that someone might be sleeping on the cargo to
guard it, and went by and up the river till the pointed
roofs of the houses were miles astern.</p>

<p>O'Hara and Gleazen and Matterson talked together,
and part of their talk was bickering among themselves,
and part was of the man Bull who, all alone in the wilderness,
was waiting for us somewhere in the jungle, and part
was in Spanish, which I could not understand. But when
they talked in Spanish, they looked keenly at Arnold and
Abe and me, and I found comfort then in thinking that,
although Arnold and I now had no chance to exchange
confidences, he was hearing and remembering every word
of their conversation. And all the time that I watched
them, I was thinking of the girl at the mission.</p>

<p>Remembering my talk with Arnold long ago, when I had
expressed so poor an opinion of all womankind, I felt at
once a little amused at myself and a little sheepish. Who
would have thought that, at almost my first sight of the
despised continent of Africa, I should see a girl whose face
I could not forget? That when she spoke to me for the
first time, her low, firm voice would so fasten itself upon
my memory, that I should hear it in my dreams both sleeping
and waking?</p>

<p>Poor Uncle Seth! Never offering to take an oar, never
exchanging a word with any of the rest of us, he sat with
his elbows on his knees and his head bowed. Gleazen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Matterson had dropped even their unkindly humorous
pretense of deferring to him. In our little band of adventurers
he who had once been so assertive, so brimful of importance,
had become the merest nonentity.</p>

<p>All that night we went up the river, and all the next day
we lay concealed among the mangroves; but about the
following midnight we came to a place where the banks
were higher and the current swifter. Here O'Hara stood
up in the bow of the boat and studied the shore and ordered
us now to row, now to rest. For all of two miles we
advanced thus, and heartily tired of his orders we were,
when he directed us to veer sharply to larboard and enter
a small creek, along the banks of which tall water-grass
grew right down to the channel.</p>

<p>There was barely room for the boat to pass along the
stream between the forests of grass which grew in the
water on the two sides; but as we advanced, the tall grass
disappeared, and the stream itself became narrower and
swifter, and the banks became higher. The country, we
now saw, was heavily timbered, and we occasionally came
to logs, which we had to pry out of the way before we
could pass. One moment we would be in water up to our
necks, another we would be poling the boat along with the
oars, until at last we grounded on a bar over which only a
runlet gurgled.</p>

<p>There was a suggestion of dawn in the east, which revealed
above and beyond the wood a line of low, bare hills;
but when I looked at the wood itself, through which we
must find our way, my courage oozed out by every pore
and left me wishing from the bottom of my heart that I
were safe at sea with Gideon North.</p>

<p>Piling all our goods on the bank, we hid the boat in the
bushes and made camp.</p>

<p>"Hard upon daylight, well be starting," said O'Hara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
hoarsely. "Sleep is it, you ask? Don't that give you your
while of sleep? Be about it. By dark, we'll reach him
surely; and if not, we'll be in the very shadow of the hill."</p>

<p>The man was all a-quiver with excitement. He jerked
his shoulders and twitched his fingers and rolled his eyes.
Matterson and Gleazen, too, were softly laughing as they
stepped a little apart from the rest of us.</p>

<p>I looked at Arnold.</p>

<p>He stood with one hand raised. "What was that?" he
asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Very faintly,&mdash;very, very far away,&mdash;we heard just
such a yell as we had heard that night when in defiance of
the wizard's warning we left the Adventure.</p>

<p>Coming to our ears at the particular moment when we
most firmly believed that by consummate craft we had so
concealed our progress up the river as to escape every
prying eye and deceive every hostile black, it both taunted
us and threatened us. Three times we heard it, faintly,
then silence, deep and ominous, ensued.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="small">A GRIM SURPRISE</span></h3>

<p>To sleep at that moment would have required more than
human self-control. Forgetting every personal grudge,
every cause of enmity, we huddled together, seven men
alone in an alien wilderness, and waited,&mdash;listened,&mdash;waited.
I, for one, more than half expected, and very
deeply feared, to hear coming from the darkness that
ghostly voice which had cried to us twice already, "White
man, I come 'peak." But, except for the whisper of the
wind and the ripple of the creek, there was no sound to be
heard.</p>

<p>The wind gently stirred the leaves, and the creek sang
as it flowed down over the gravel and away through the
reeds. The moon cast its pale light upon us, and the remote
stars twinkled in the heavens. The cries, after that
second repetition, died away, and at that moment did not
come back. But our night of adventure was not yet at
an end.</p>

<p>O'Hara deliberately leveled his index finger at the bed
of the stream above us. "Sure, now, and there do be
someone there," he whispered. "Watch now! Watch me!"</p>

<p>Stepping forward, with a slow, tigerish motion, he
slightly raised his voice. "Come you out!" he said distinctly.
Then he spoke in a gibberish of which I could
make no more sense than if it had been so much Spanish.</p>

<p>Before our very eyes, silently, there rose from the
undergrowth a great negro with a spear.</p>

<p>Arnold Lamont gave a quick gasp and I saw steel flash
in the moonlight as his hand moved. Gleazen swore;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Matterson started to his feet; Abe Guptil came suddenly
to a crouching position. But O'Hara, after one sharply in-drawn
breath, uttered a name and whispered something
in that same language, which I knew well I had never
heard before, and the negro answered him in kind.</p>

<p>For a moment they talked rapidly; then O'Hara turned
to his comrades and in a frightened undertone said, "The
black devils know the worst."</p>

<p>"Well?" retorted Gleazen, angrily. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"This"&mdash;O'Hara's leveled finger indicated the negro&mdash;"is
Kaw-tah-bah."</p>

<p>"Well?" Gleazen reiterated, still more angrily.</p>

<p>"The war has razed his village to the ground."</p>

<p>Matterson now stepped forward and looked closely into
the negro's face. Gleazen followed him.</p>

<p>"He laid down eight slave money," said O'Hara. "It
was no good. They knew he was our friend. His wives, his
children, his old father, all are dead."</p>

<p>Now Matterson spoke in the same strange tongue,
slowly and hesitantly, but so that the negro understood
him and answered him.</p>

<p>"He says," O'Hara translated, "that Bull built the
house on the king's grave, and they feared him, because
he is a terrible man; and because they feared him they
left him alone in his house and brought the war to his
friend, Kaw-tah-bah. Kaw-tah-bah's people are slaves.
His wives, his children, his old father, all are dead. But
he did not betray the secret."</p>

<p>Again Matterson spoke and again the negro answered.</p>

<p>"He says," cried O'Hara, "that Bull is waiting there on
the hill by the king's grave."</p>

<p>The negro suddenly uttered a low exclamation.</p>

<p>Standing as still as so many statues, we heard yet again
that faint, unearthly wail far off in the night, a wail, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
before, twice repeated. The third cry had scarcely died
away, when the negro, with a startled gasp, darted into
the brush.</p>

<p>O'Hara raised his hand and called to him to come back;
but, never turning his head, he disappeared like a frightened
animal.</p>

<p>Again we were alone in the wilderness.</p>

<p>To me, now, all that formerly I had understood only in
vague outline had become clear in every detail. I knew, of
course, that, after their own ship was wrecked, our quartette
of adventurers had sent Gleazen back to America, to
get by hook or crook another vessel to serve their godless
purposes; and I knew that they had implicated my deluded
uncle in something more than ordinary slave trade.
Their talk of the man who had stayed behind for a purpose
still further convinced me that Arnold had been
right; I remembered the rough stones on the table in the
cabin the night when I took the four by surprise. But it
was only common sense that, if our first guess were <i>all</i>
their secret, they would have smuggled such a find down
to the coast, and have taken their chance in embarking in
the first vessel that came to port. There was more than
that of which to be mindful, and I knew well enough
what.</p>

<p>"I say, now, push forward this very minute," cried
O'Hara. "Better travel a bad road by dark in safety than
a good road by day that will land every mother's son of us
in the place where there's no road back."</p>

<p>"The black devils are hard upon us," Gleazen cried.
"Lay low, I say. Come afternoon we'll sneak along easy
like."</p>

<p>"I stand with Bud O'Hara," said Matterson, slowly.
"It'll not be so easy to hit us by moonlight as by sunlight."</p>

<p>"And once we're with Bull in the little fort that he'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
have made for us," Bud persisted, "we'll be safe surely."</p>

<p>"It is harder to travel by night," said Arnold. "But
it is easier by night than by day to evade an enemy."</p>

<p>The others looked at him curiously, as if surprised by
his temerity in speaking out; but, oddly, his seemed to be
the deciding voice. Working with furious haste, we sorted
our goods and made them up into six packs, which we
shouldered according to our strength. But as we worked,
we would stop and look furtively around; and at the slightest
sound we would start and stare. Our determination to
go through to the end of our adventure had not flagged
when at last we gathered beside the thicket where we had
concealed the boat; but we were seven silent men who
left the boat, the creek, and the river behind us, and with
O'Hara to guide us set off straight into the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>O'Hara's long sojourn on the continent, which had
made him a "black man" in the sense that he had come to
believe, or at least more than half believe, in the silly superstitions
of the natives, had served him better by giving
him an amazing knowledge of the country. That he was
following a trail he had traveled many times before would
have been evident to a less keenly interested observer than
I. But though he had traveled it ever so many times, it
was a mystery to me how he could follow it unerringly, by
moonlight alone, through black tangles of forest growth
so dense that scarcely a ray stole down on the deeply shadowed
path.</p>

<p>Passing over some high hills, we came, sweaty and
breathless, down into a rocky gorge, along which we hurried,
now skirting patches of cotton and corn and yams,
now making a long dtour around a sleeping village, until
we arrived at a wood in a valley where a deep stream
rumbled. And all this time we had seen no sign whatever
of any living creature other than ourselves.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>It was already full daylight, and throwing off our burdens,
we flung ourselves down and slept. Had our danger
been even more urgent, I believe that we could not have
kept awake, so exhausted were we; and indeed, we were
in greater peril than we had supposed, for all that day,
whenever we woke, we heard at no great distance from
our place of concealment the thump of a pestle pounding
rice.</p>

<p>Twelve hours of daylight would easily have brought us
to our destination. But it was slow work traveling in the
darkness, and we still had far to go. Pushing on again
that night, we pressed through a country thickly wooded
with tall trees, many of which elephants had broken down
in order to feed on the tender upper branches.</p>

<p>As we passed them, I was thrilled to see with my own
eyes the work of wild elephants in their native country,
and should have liked to stop for a time; but there was
no opportunity to loiter, and leaving the woods behind us,
we came at daylight to a brook, which had cut a deep
channel into dark slate rock and blue clay.</p>

<p>Here I conjectured that we should camp for another
day, but not so: our three leaders were strangely excited.</p>

<p>"Sure," O'Hara cried, pointing at a low hill at a distance
in the plain, "sure, gentlemen, and there's our port.
Where's the man would cast anchor this side of it?"</p>

<p>O'Hara, Gleazen, and Matterson stood at one side, and
Arnold, Abe, and I at the other, with my poor uncle in the
middle. We had not concerted to divide thus. Instinctively
and unconsciously we separated into hostile factions,
with poor Seth Upham&mdash;neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, as
they say&mdash;standing weakly between us. But even so, the
enthusiasm of the three was contagious. Weary though we
were, we strongly felt it. We had come so far, all of us,
and had wondered so much and so often about our mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
errand, that now, with the end in sight, not one of us,
I believe, would have stopped.</p>

<p>Casting caution to the winds, we swung down into a
wild country and across the broad plain, where, after some
three hours of rough hard travel, we came to the foot of the
hill. And in all this time, except the patches of tilled land
that we had passed, the towns that we had avoided, the
thumping of pestles and the occasional sounds of domestic
animals, we had seen and heard no sign of human life.
It is not strange that for the moment I forgot the threats
that had caused us such anxiety. Stopping only to catch
our breath and drink and dash over our faces water from a
brook, we started up the hill.</p>

<p>O'Hara, ahead of us all, was like a mad man in his eagerness,
and Matterson and Gleazen were not far behind
him. Even Uncle Seth caught something of their frenzy
and assumed an empty show of his old pompousness and
sharp manner.</p>

<p>Up the hill we went, our three leaders first, then, in
nervous haste, between the two parties literally as well as
figuratively, my uncle, then Arnold and Abe and I, who
were soon outdistanced, in that fierce scramble, by all but
Uncle Seth.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Joe," Abe said in a low voice, as he
gave me a hand up over a bit of a ledge, "I'd sooner be
home on my little farm that Seth Upham sold from under
me, with only my crops and fishing to look forward to,
than here with all the gold in Africa to be got? I wonder,
Joe, if I'll ever see my wife and the little boy again."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I cried, "of course you will."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? I'm not so sure."</p>

<p>As we stood for a moment on the summit of the ledge,
I saw that we had chosen a rougher, more circuitous path
than was necessary. The others had gone up a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
swale on our right, where tall, lush grass indicated that the
ground was marshy. It irritated me that we should have
scrambled over the rocks for nothing; my legs were atremble
from our haste.</p>

<p>"Of course you will," I repeated testily. Then I saw
something move. "See!" I cried. "There goes an animal
of some kind."</p>

<p>While for a moment we waited in hope of seeing again
whatever it was that had moved, I thought, oddly enough,
of the girl at the mission; then my thoughts leaped back
half round the world to little Topham, and returned by
swift steps, through all our adventures, to the spot where
we stood.</p>

<p>Now the others were bawling at us to come along after
them, so Abe and I turned, not having seen distinctly
whatever animal there may have been, and followed them
up the hill.</p>

<p>"Here's the brook!" O'Hara cried, "the brook from the
spring!"</p>

<p>He was running now, straight up through the tall grass
beside the tiny trickle, and we were driving along at his
heels as hard as we could go.</p>

<p>"Here's the clearing, and never a blade of grass is
changed since I left it last! O Bull! Here we are! See,
men, see! Yonder on the old grave is the house all wattled
like a nigger hut! O Bull! Where are you? But it's fine
inside, men, I'll warrant you. He was laying to build it
good. He said he'd fix it up like a duke's mansion. O Bull!
I say, Bull!"</p>

<p>There indeed was the house, on a low mound, which
showed the marks of sacrilegious pick and shovel. The
posts on which it stood were driven straight down into the
hillock. But in reply to O'Hara's loud hail no answer came
from that silent, apparently deserted dwelling.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>O'Hara turned and, as if apologizing, said in a lower
voice, but still loud enough for us to hear, "Sure, now, and
he must be out somewhere."</p>

<p>Then he waited for us, and we gathered in a little group
and looked at the wattled hut as if in apprehension,
although of course there was no reason on earth why we
should have been apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Arnold, very quietly, "why not
go in?"</p>

<p>Not a man stirred.</p>

<p>O'Hara faced about with moodily clouded eyes. "Well,
then," he gasped, "he <i>would</i> build it on the king's grave."</p>

<p>I am sure that my face, for one, told O'Hara that he
only mystified me.</p>

<p>"Sure, and he was like others I've seen. More than
once I warned him, but he didn't believe in nigger gods.
He didn't believe in nigger gods, and he built the house
on the king's grave! On the king's grave, mind you! He
was that set and reckless."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Arnold, again, very quietly, very
precisely, "why not go in?"</p>

<p>All this time my uncle, as was his way except in those
rare moments when he made a pitiful show of regaining
his old peremptory manner, had been standing by in silence,
looking from one to another of our company. But
now he hesitantly spoke up.</p>

<p>"He has not been here for some time," he said.</p>

<p>Gleazen turned with a scornful grunt. "Much you know
whether he has or not," he retorted.</p>

<p>"See!" My uncle pointed at the door. "Vines have
grown across the top of it."</p>

<p>Gleazen softly swore, and Matterson said, "For once,
Neil, he's right."</p>

<p>Why we had not noticed it before, I cannot say; probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
we were too much excited. But we all saw it now,
and Gleazen, staring at the dark shadow of the leaves on
the door, stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>"By Heaven," he whispered, "I don't like to go in."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Arnold, speaking for the third time,
ever quietly and precisely, "I am not afraid to go in."</p>

<p>When he boldly went up to the house ahead of us, we,
ashamed to hang back, reluctantly followed.</p>

<p>To this day I can see him in every detail as he laid his
hand on the latch. His blue coat, which fitted so snugly
his tall, straight figure, seemed to draw from the warm sunlight
a brighter, more intense hue. His black hair and
white, handsome face stood out in bold relief against the
dark door, and the green leaves drooped round him and
formed a living frame.</p>

<p>Setting his shoulders against the door, he straightened
his body and heaved mightily and broke the rusty latch.
The hinges creaked loudly, the vine tore away, the door
opened, and in we walked, to see the most dreadful sight
my eyes have ever beheld.</p>

<p>There in a chair by the table sat a stark skeleton dressed
in good sound clothes. The arms and skull lay on the table
itself beside a great heap of those rough quartz-like stones,&mdash;I
knew now well enough what they were,&mdash;and the
bony fingers still held a pen, which rested on a sheet of
yellow foolscap where a great brown blot marked the end
of the last word that the man they called Bull had ever
written. Between the ribs of the skeleton, through the
good coat and into the back of the chair in such a way that
it held the body in a sitting posture, stuck a long spear.</p>

<p>Of the seven of us who stared in horror at that terrible
object, Matterson was the first to utter a word. His voice
was singularly meditative, detached.</p>

<p>"He never knew&mdash;see!&mdash;it took him unawares."</p>

<div class="p2 figcenter">
<img src="images/illus_0386.jpg" width="335" height="500" alt="A skeleton" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>There in a chair by the table sat a stark skeleton dressed in good sound clothes.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
O'Hara slowly went to the table, leaned over it, and
looking incredulously at the paper, as if he could not believe
his eyes, burst suddenly into a frenzy of grief and
rage.</p>

<p>"Lads," he cried, "look there! My name was the last
thing he wrote. O Bull, I warned ye, I warned ye&mdash;how
many times I warned ye! And yet ye <i>would</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>would</i>
build the house on the king's grave. O Bull!"</p>

<p>He drew the yellow paper out from under the fleshless
fingers and held it up for all of us to see, and we read in a
clear flowing hand the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">My dear O'Hara:&mdash;</span></span><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p>Not having heard from you this long time, I take my
pen in hand to inform you that I am well and that despite
your silly fears, no harm has come of building our house on
the sightliest spot hereabouts. Martin Brown, the trader,
from whom I bought the hinges and fittings will carry this
letter to you and&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>There it ended in a great blot. Whence had the spear
come? Why had Martin Brown never called for the letter?
Or had he called and gone away again?</p>

<p>What scenes that page of cheap, yellowed paper, from
which the faded brown writing stared at us, had witnessed!
It was indeed as if a dead man were speaking; and more
than that, for the paper on which the man had been writing
when he died had remained ever since under his very
hands, undisturbed by all that had happened. How long
must the man have been dead, I wondered. The stark
white bones uncannily fascinated me. I saw that the
feather had been stripped from the bare quill of the pen:
could moths have done that? A knife could not have
stripped it so cleanly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Abe Guptil, who had been prowling about, now spoke,
and we looked where he pointed and saw on the floor under
a window the print of a single bare foot as clearly
marked in mud as if it had been placed there yesterday.</p>

<p>"Hm! He saw that the job was done and went away
again," said Gleazen, coolly.</p>

<p>I stared about the hut, from which apparently not a
thing had been stolen, and thought that it was the more
remarkable, because there were pans and knives in plain
sight that would have been a fortune to an African black.
The open ink-bottle, in which were a few brown crystals,
the pen, which was cut from the quill of some African
bird, and the faded letter, which was scarcely begun, told
us that the spear, hurled through the open window, had
pierced the man's body and snuffed out his life, without
so much as a word of warning.</p>

<p>O'Hara unsteadily laid the letter down and stepped
back. His face was still white. "It's words from the
dead," he gasped.</p>

<p>"So it is," said Matterson, "but he's panned out a
noble lot of stones."</p>

<p>As if Matterson's effeminate voice had again goaded
him to fury, O'Hara burst out anew.</p>

<p>"You'd talk o' stones, would ye? Stones to me, that has
lost the best friend surely ever man had? A man that
would ha' laid down his very life for me; and now the niggers
have got him and the ants have stripped his bones!
O-o-oh!&mdash;" And throwing himself into a rough chair
that the dead man himself had made, O'Hara sobbed like
a little boy.</p>

<p>Matterson and Gleazen nodded to each other, as much
as to say that it was too bad, but that no one had any call
to take on to such an extent; and Gleazen with a shrug
thrust a finger into that heap of stones, slowly, as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
could not quite believe his senses,&mdash;little <i>he</i> cared for any
man's life!&mdash;while those of us who until now had been so
hypnotized by horror that we had not laid down our packs
dropped them on the floor.</p>

<p>"Ants," O'Hara had said: I knew now why the bones
were so clean and white; why the feather was stripped
from the quill.</p>

<p>From the windows of the hut, which stood in a clearing
at the very top of the hill, we could see for miles through
occasional vistas in the tall timber below us. The edge of
the clearing, on all sides except that by which we had approached
it, had grown into a tangled net of vines, which
had crept out into the open space to mingle with saplings
and green shrubs. Half way down the hill, where we had
passed it in our haste, I now saw, by the character of the
vegetation, was the spring from which issued the brook
whose course we had followed.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, who had been striving to appear at ease
since the first shock of seeing the single occupant of the
house, came over beside me; and after a few remarks,
which touched me because they were so obviously a pathetic
effort to win back my friendship and affection, said
in a louder voice, "Thank God, <i>we</i>, at least, are safe!"</p>

<p>The word to O'Hara was like spark to powder.</p>

<p>Flaring up again, he shrieked, "Safe&mdash;<i>you!</i>&mdash;and you
thank God for it! You white-livered milk-sop of a country
storekeeper, what is your cowardly life worth to yourself
or to any one else? You safe!" He swore mightily.
"You! I tell you, Upham, <i>there</i>&mdash;" he pointed at the
skeleton by the table&mdash;"<i>there</i> was a <i>man</i>! You safe!"</p>

<p>Withered by the contempt in the fellow's voice, Uncle
Seth stepped back from the window, turned round, and,
as if puzzling what to say next, bent his head.</p>

<p>As he did so, a single arrow flew with a soft hiss in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
through the window, passed exactly where his head had
just that moment been, and with a hollow <i>thump</i> struck
trembling into the opposite wall. There was not a sound
outside, not the motion of a leaf, to show whence the arrow
came. Only the arrow whispering through the air and
trembling in the wall.</p>

<p>Uncle Seth, as yellow as old parchment, looked up with
distended eyes at the still quivering missile.</p>

<p>"Safe, you say?" cried Gleazen with a hoarse laugh,
still letting those little stones fall between his fingers.
The man at times was a fiend for utter recklessness. "Aye,
safe on the knees of Mumbo-Jumbo!"</p>

<p>I heard this, of course, but in a singularly absent way;
for at that moment, when every man of us was staring at
the arrow in the wall, I, strangely enough, was thinking of
the girl at the mission.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="small">SIEGE</span></h3>

<p>Much as I hated and distrusted Cornelius Gleazen,&mdash;and
in the months since I first saw him sitting on the tavern
porch in Topham he had given me reason for both,&mdash;I
continually wondered at his reckless nonchalance.</p>

<p>As coolly as if he were in our village store, with a codfish
swinging above the table, instead of a skeleton leaning
against it, and with a boy's dart trembling in a beam,
instead of an arrow thrust half through the wall&mdash;with
just such a grand gesture as he had used to overawe the
good people of Topham, he stepped to the door and
brushed his hair back from his forehead. The diamond
still flashed on his finger; his bearing was as impressive as
ever.</p>

<p>"Well, lads," he said,&mdash;and little as I liked him, his
calmness was somehow reassuring,&mdash;"there <i>may</i> be a
hundred of 'em out there, but again there <i>may</i> be only one.
First of all, we'll need water. I'll fetch it."</p>

<p>From a peg on the wall he took down a bucket and, returning
to the door, stepped out.</p>

<p>In the clearing, where the hot sun was shining, I could
see no sign of life.</p>

<p>Pausing on the doorstone, Gleazen shrugged his great
shoulders and stretched himself and moved his fingers so
that the diamond in his ring flashed a score of colors. He
was a handsome man in his big, rakehell way; and in spite
of all I knew against him, I could but admire his bravado
as he turned from us.</p>

<p>Boldly, deliberately, he stepped down into the grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
while we crowded in the door and watched him. After all,
it seemed that there was really nothing to be afraid of.
The rest of us were startled and angry when O'Hara suddenly
called out, "Come back, you blithering fool! Come
back! You don't know them, Neil; I say, you don't know
them. Come back, I say!"</p>

<p>With a scornful smile Gleazen turned again and airily
waved his hand&mdash;I saw the diamond catch the sunlight
as he did so. Then he gave a groan and dropped the bucket
and cried out in pain and stumbled back over the threshold.</p>

<p>With muskets we sprang to guard door and window.
But outside the hut there was no living thing to be seen.
There was not even wind enough to move the leaves of the
trees, which hung motionless in the sunlight.</p>

<p>It was as if we were in the midst of a nightmare from
which shortly we should wake up. The whole ghastly incident
seemed so utterly unreal! But when we looked at
Gleazen, we knew that it was no mere nightmare. It was
terrible reality. Blood was dripping from his left hand and
running down on his shoe.</p>

<p>Through his hand, half on one side of it, half on the
other, was thrust an arrow. A second arrow had passed
just under the skin of his leg.</p>

<p>From the door I could see the bucket lying in the grass
where he had dropped it; but except for a pair of parrots,
which were flying from tree to tree, there still was no living
thing in sight.</p>

<p>The vine-hung walls of the forest, which reached out
long tendrils and straggling clumps of undergrowth as if to
seize upon and consume the space of open ground, stood
tall and green and silent. The deep grass waved in the
faintest of breezes. Above a single big rock the hot air
swayed and trembled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Without even wincing, Gleazen drew the arrow from his
hand and, refusing assistance, bound the wound himself.</p>

<p>Turning from the door, Arnold went to the table and
touched an arm of the skeleton, which fell toward the
body and collapsed inside the sleeve with a low rattle.</p>

<p>O'Hara raised his hand with an angry gesture.</p>

<p>"I mean no irreverence," said Arnold.</p>

<p>For a moment the two stood at gaze, then, letting his
hand fall, O'Hara stepped over beside Arnold, and they
lifted the bones, which for the most part fell together in
the dead man's clothes, and laid them by the north wall.</p>

<p>"And what," asked Matterson, curiously, "are you two
doing now?"</p>

<p>Without answering, Arnold coolly swept the stones on
the table together between his hands into a more compact
pile.</p>

<p>"Hands off, my boy," said Gleazen, quietly.</p>

<p>"Well?" Gleazen's words had brought a flush to Arnold's
cheeks. He himself was nearly as old as Gleazen
and was quick to resent the patronizing tone, and his very
quietness was more threatening than the loudest bluster.</p>

<p>"Hands off," Gleazen repeated; and raising his musket,
he cocked it and tapped the muzzle on the opposite side
of the table. "This says 'hands off,' too." He glanced
around so that we could see that he meant us all. "Matterson,
ain't there a sack somewhere hereabouts?" But
for the blood on his shoe and the stained cloth round his
hand, he gave no sign of having been wounded.</p>

<p>From under the table Matterson picked up a bag such
as might have been used for salt, but which was made of
strong canvas and was grimy from much handling.</p>

<p>"He was always a careful man," Gleazen remarked with
a glance at the skeleton heaped up in the shadow of the
wall. "I thought he would have provided a bag."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Gleazen and Matterson then, with pains not to miss a
single one, picked up the stones by handfuls and let them
rattle into the bag like shot.</p>

<p>"And now," said Gleazen, when the last one was in and
the neck of the bag was tied, "once more: <i>hands off!</i>"</p>

<p>Laying the bag beside the skeleton, he took his stand in
front of it, with Matterson and O'Hara on his right and
left.</p>

<p>So far as the three of them were concerned, we might
have been killed a dozen times over, had anyone seen fit
to attack us. But Abe and I, all the time keeping one eye
on the strange scene inside the cabin, had kept watch also
for trouble from without, and all the time not a thing had
stirred in the clearing.</p>

<p>"What," Matterson again asked, still watching Arnold
curiously, "what are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>Tipping the table up on one side and wrenching off one
of the boards that formed the top of it, Arnold placed it
across a window, so that there was a slit at the bottom
through which we could watch or shoot.</p>

<p>"Now, there's an idea!" Gleazen exclaimed. But he
never stirred from in front of the skeleton and the bag.</p>

<p>"There are nails in the table," said Arnold.</p>

<p>Matterson smiled, and taking the board in one hand,
tapped a nail against the table to start it, and with the
thumb and forefinger of the other hand drew it out as easily
as if it had been stuck in putty. "For a hammer," he
said lightly, "use the butt of a musket."</p>

<p>"Look!" my uncle exclaimed: he was pointing at a good
claw-hammer, which hung over the door.</p>

<p>The hut fell far short of the duke's mansion that its
luckless builder had promised O'Hara, but it had a window
in each of three walls, and the door in the fourth, so that,
by cutting a hole through the door, we were able, after we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
had barricaded the windows, to guard against surprise
from any quarter without exposing ourselves to a chance
shot; and as we had brought four muskets, we were able
to give each sentry one well loaded.</p>

<p>The silence deepened. The air was fairly alive with
suspicion. When Uncle Seth nervously moistened his lips,
we all heard him; and when he flushed and shifted his
feet, the creaking of a board seemed harsh and loud.</p>

<p>"Well," said Gleazen, slowly, "I'll stand in one watch
and Matterson here will stand in the other. For the rest,
suit yourselves."</p>

<p>Another long, uncomfortable silence fell upon us.</p>

<p>"Then," said Arnold, at last, "since no one else suggests
an arrangement, I would suggest that Mr. Matterson,
O'Hara, Mr. Upham, and I stand the first watch;
that Mr. Gleazen, Joe Woods, and Abe Guptil stand
second watch; and in order to put four men in each watch
in turn, since we must have four to guard against surprise
from any direction, I suggest that each man, turn and
turn about, stands a double watch of eight hours. I myself
will take the double watch first."</p>

<p>"That is good as far as it goes," Matterson interposed
in his light voice. "But a single watch of two hours, with
the double watch of four, is long enough. A man grows
sleepy sooner with his eye at a knothole than if he is
walking the deck."</p>

<p>Arnold nodded, "We agree to that," he replied.</p>

<p>"Lads," said Gleazen, quite unexpectedly, "let's have
an end of hard looks and hard words. Come, Joe,&mdash;come,
Arnold,&mdash;don't take sides against us and good Seth
Upham. We're all in this fix together, and, by heaven!
unless we stand together and come out together, not one
of us'll come out alive."</p>

<p>The man now seemed so frank, and in the face of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
common danger so genial, that, if I had not still felt the
sting of the flattery by which he had deceived me so outrageously
in the old days in Topham, I should have been
convinced that he was sincere in every word he uttered.
As it was, sincere or false, I knew that for the moment he
was honest. However his attitude toward us might change
when our troubles were past, for the time being we did
share a common danger, and it was imperative that we
stand together. But to speak of my poor uncle as if he
were hand in glove with the three of them and on equal
terms exasperated me.</p>

<p>Seth Upham's face was drawn and anxious. It was plain
that his spirit was broken, and I believed, when I looked
at him, that never again would he make a show of standing
up to the man who had virtually robbed him of all he
possessed.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Arnold Lamont, thoughtfully and with that
quaint, almost indefinable touch of foreign accent, "that
is true. We might say that we don't know what you mean
by offering us a truce. We might pretend that we have always
been, and always shall be, on the friendliest of terms
with you. But we know, as well as you, that it is not so.
Since we share a common danger and since our safety depends
on our mutual loyalty, we, sir, agree to your offer.
A truce it shall be while our danger lasts, and here's my
hand that it will be an honest truce."</p>

<p>It was easy to see that Gleazen and Matterson were not
altogether pleased by his words. They would have liked,
I think, to have us apprehend the situation less clearly.
But there was nothing to do but make the best of matters;
so Gleazen shook Arnold's hand, and we took an inventory
of our provisions, which were quite too few to last through
a siege of any length.</p>

<p>"To-morrow night, surely we can run for it," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
O'Hara. "To-night they'll watch us like hawks, but to-morrow
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>Plainly it was that for which we must wait.</p>

<p>We divided our food into equal portions, each to serve
for one meal,&mdash;the meals, we saw, were to be very few,&mdash;ate
one portion on the spot and settled ourselves to watch
and sleep. But before I fell asleep I heard something that
still further enlightened me.</p>

<p>"Now, why," asked Gleazen, sourly, as he faced the
other two in the darkness, "couldn't <i>one</i> of you ha'
stayed with Bull, even if the other was fool enough to go
a-wandering?"</p>

<p>Matterson quietly smiled. "Bud, here, swore he'd never
leave him."</p>

<p>"We-e-ell," O'Hara drawled, irritably, "you was both
of you too long gone and Bull was set in his ways. It was
'Step this side,' and 'Step that!' And 'Those stones are
yourn and those are mine and those are for the company.'
Says I at last, 'Them that you've laid out for me, I'll
take to the coast. Keep the rest of them if you wish.'
Says he, 'You'll leave me here to rot.' 'Not so,' says I.
'By hook or by crook Neil will get the vessel surely, and
Molly will arrange the market surely, for they're good
men and not to be turned lightly off. Do you clean the
pocket, and build the house. Surely the pocket that has
sent Neil home like a gentleman, and has sent Molly west
like a man of business, will provide us at least the wherewithal
to buy <i>one</i> cargo. And with a cargo under our own
hatches,' says I, 'four fortunes will soon be made.' 'Do
you go,' says he, 'and I'll build a house like a duke's mansion
to live in, and dig the pocket out and make friends
with the niggers, which eventually we will catch, and four
fortunes we will make.' So I come away, and you two
surely would 'a' done the same if you'd been in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
breeches instead of me; and then he went and built his
house on the king's grave!"</p>

<p>As I lay on the floor, not three feet from the skeleton
and from the round bag of quartz-like stones, through
half-closed eyes I saw against the door, beyond which the
sun was shining with intense heat, the great black shadow
that I knew was Matterson, with a musket across his
knees; then, so exhausted was I, that I forgot the grim
object within arm's length of where I lay, forgot our feud
with Matterson and Gleazen and O'Hara, forgot every
ominous event that had happened since the Adventure
had set sail four days before and moved down the river
toward the open sea, and, falling asleep, dreamed of someone
whom, strangely, I could not forget.</p>

<p>The sun had set and the moon was up when my turn
came to go on guard. Taking Matterson's musket and his
place by the open door where I could see all that went on
without, but where no one outside could see me in the
dark of the hut, I settled myself with my back against the
jamb. In Matterson's motions as he handed me the musket
and went over by the skeleton and lay down, there was
the same lithe strength that he had revealed when he
lifted himself to the taffrail and boarded the Adventure in
Havana harbor. I marveled that he could endure so much
with so little drain on his physical powers.</p>

<p>"Watch sharply, Joe, there's a brave lad," he said in
his light voice.</p>

<p>As he crossed the hut and laid his great body on the
floor, so slowly yet so lightly, I thought to myself that I
had never seen a lazier man. What a power he might have
been at sea or ashore, had he had but a tithe of Gleazen's
bold effrontery! Although he had shown none of Gleazen's
passionate recklessness, he had given no sign of fear under
any circumstances that we had yet encountered. I wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
if it were not likely that the man's very quietness,
the complete absence of such petulance as Gleazen sometimes
showed, sprang from a deep, well-proved confidence
in his own might.</p>

<p>I was glad that it had fallen to me to guard the door
rather than a window. Whereas from the windows one
could see only a short space of rough open park and then
the intermatted tangle of vines, from the door the vista
ran far down the hill to the open glade where, hidden in
deep grass, the spring lay. But though I sat with the musket
beside me for hours, and though the moon rose higher
and higher, revealing every tree and bush, in all my watch
I did not see one thing astir outside the hut.</p>

<p>I must repeat that we seemed to be living in a dream.
We had seen no enemy, heard no enemy. For all the signs
and sights that those walls of tangled creepers revealed to
us, there might have been no human being within a hundred
miles. Yet from behind those walls had come three
arrows, and for the time being those three arrows locked
us in the hut as fast as if they had been bolts and chains
and padlocks.</p>

<p>As I watched, I heard someone get up and walk around
the hut; and when I glanced over my shoulder, I saw that
it was my uncle. To my surprise he was talking in a low
voice. Now what, I wondered, possessed him to stay
awake when he might be sleeping.</p>

<p>"I must be getting home," I heard him say as he came
nearer; and his voice startled me because, although it
spoke softly, it was the old sharp, domineering voice that
I had known so long and so well in Topham; "I must be
getting home. I don't know when I've stayed so late at
the store."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="small">SORTIE</span></h3>

<p>Night and morning we got little rest. We ate another
meal from our slender store; but it was a fearful thing to
see how few meals remained; and though in part we satisfied
our hunger, our thirst seemed more unendurable
than ever.</p>

<p>"Eat light and belt tight," O'Hara muttered. "Last
night they was watching like cats at a rat-hole. To-night
surely they'll not be so eager. It'll be to-night that we can
make our dash to the river."</p>

<p>Once more the sun was shining on the green, open space
around the hut. A huge butterfly, blazing with gaudy
tropical colors, fluttered out from some nook among the
creepers where it had been hidden, and on slow wings
sailed almost up to us, loitered a moment beside a blue
flower, and again took flight through the still air to the
opposite forest wall.</p>

<p>"If Neil Gleazen had as much brains under his hair as
he has hair to cover his head," Matterson softly remarked,
"we'd have brought enough food so that we'd not have to
go hungry."</p>

<p>"Food!" Gleazen roared. "Food, is it? You eat like a
hog, you glutton. And who was to know that Bull would
not have a house full of food to feast us on? Who was to
know that Bull would be dead?"</p>

<p>At that a silence fell upon us.</p>

<p>As usual, though we had agreed to a truce between our
two parties, Gleazen, Matterson, and O'Hara sat on one
side of the room, the side where the skeleton and the bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of pebbles lay, and Arnold, Abe and I sat on the other,
with poor Uncle Seth wandering about at will between us.</p>

<p>There was that in my uncle's manner which I could not
understand; and as I watched him, Abe Guptil touched
my elbow.</p>

<p>"Something queer ails Seth Upham," he whispered.</p>

<p>"I know it," I replied.</p>

<p>"I don't like to see him act that way."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>Abe regarded me thoughtfully. "Now ain't it queer how
things turn out?" he whispered. "I mind the day you
come to my house and told me I'd got to flit. It was a
bitter day for me, Joe, and yet do you know, I'd kind o'
like to be back there, even if it was all to go through again.
I swear, though, I'd never sail again with Mr. Gleazen."</p>

<p>There was something so ingenuous in Abe's way of saying
that he wished he had never come, that I smiled; but
it touched me to remember all that Abe and I had faced
together; and Abe himself, with keen Yankee shrewdness,
added in an undertone, "It's all very well for O'Hara to
talk of making our break to-night. I'm thinking, Joe, it is
upon us a storm will break before we get free and clear of
this camp."</p>

<p>As the sun rose higher and higher, the sunlight steadily
grew warmer. The air shimmered with heat, and the house
itself became as hot, it seemed, as an oven over a charcoal
fire. Sweat streamed from our faces and, having had no
water now for nearly twenty-four hours, we suffered agonies
of thirst.</p>

<p>Never were men in a more utterly tantalizing predicament.
Whether or not it was cooler outside the hut than
within, it surely could have been no hotter; and from the
door straight down the hill to the spring there led a broad,
open path. The spring was only a short distance away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
there was, so far as we could see, not a living creature between
us and cold water in abundance. Hour after hour
the green, deep grass around it mocked us. Yet in the
wattled hut, under the thatched roof, we were prisoners.</p>

<p>Three arrows, shot by we knew not whom, every one of
them now in our own hands, were the only warnings that
we had received; but not a man of us dared disobey the
message that those three arrows had brought.</p>

<p>The day wore on, through the long and dreary watches
of the morning, through the tortures of high noon, and
through the less harsh afternoon hours. We ate another of
our few remaining meals and watched the sun set and the
darkness come swiftly. The shadows, growing longer
and longer, reached out across the clearing to the trees on
the opposite side; and suddenly, darkly, swept up the
eastern wall of the forest. As the light vanished, night
enfolded us. The stars that flashed into the sky only intensified
the utter blackness of the woods.</p>

<p>O'Hara uneasily stirred and stretched himself in the
darkness like a dog.</p>

<p>"Now, lads," he whispered, "now's the time to gather
things together. At two in the morning we'll run for it.
Then's the hour they'll be sleeping like so many black
pigs."</p>

<p>Gleazen moved and groaned,&mdash;it was almost the first
time that he had yielded in the least to the pain of his
wound.</p>

<p>"Can you travel by yourself, Neil?" Matterson asked.
"Or shall I carry you on my back?"</p>

<p>When it came to me that the question was no joke, that
Matterson actually meant it, I could not keep from staring
at him in amazement. He was a tremendous man, but
there was something honestly heroic in his offering to carry
Cornelius Gleazen's weight back over all those miles.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Gleazen smiled and shook his head. "Thanks, Mat," he
replied, "but I'll make out to scramble along."</p>

<p>The word "scramble," it seemed, caught Uncle Seth's
attention, and with a curt nod, he said, "Yes, scramble
them; use them any way but boiled. We can't sell cracked
eggs in the store, but they're perfectly good to use at
home."</p>

<p>We all looked in amazement, and Gleazen, in spite of his
pain, hoarsely laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, Seth," he cried, "are you gone crazy?"</p>

<p>My uncle stared blankly at him and continued to pace
the room.</p>

<p>In the silence that ensued, Gleazen's words seemed to
echo and recho; though they were spoken quietly, even
in jest, their significance was truly terrible.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Arnold Lamont in a very low voice,
"Seth Upham, I fear, is not well. We must not let him
stand guard. <i>We cannot trust him!</i>"</p>

<p>"Name of heaven!" whispered Matterson, "the man's
right. Upham is turning queer."</p>

<p>As I watched my uncle, my mother's only brother, the
last of all my kin, a choking rose in my throat. He did
not see me at all. He saw none of us. In mind and spirit
he was thousands of miles away from us. I started toward
him, but when his eyes met mine dully and with no indication
that he recognized me, I swallowed hard and turned
back.</p>

<p>Never was a night so long and ghastly! With all prepared
for our dash to the river, with Uncle Seth wandering
back and forth, and with the rest of us divided into three
watches of two each, that overlapped by an hour, so that
four men were always on guard, we watched and waited
until midnight passed and the morning hours came.</p>

<p>When the moon was at the zenith, O'Hara woke Matterson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
and we gathered by the packs, which were made
up and ready.</p>

<p>"Poor Bull!" said O'Hara, brushing his hand across his
eyes. "Sure, and I hate to leave him thus. If ever man
deserved a decent burial, it's him."</p>

<p>"If men got what they deserved," Gleazen briefly retorted,
"Bull would never have drove the ship on the
island, and we'd never have had to divide up this here
find which Bull dug up for us, and Bull would never have
had to stand by the hill to get himself killed, in the first
place."</p>

<p>Each man had tied up his own belongings to suit himself,
and had put in his pocket his share of what little food
was left. The different packs stood in the middle of the
hut, but it was noticeable that, although each man was
nearest his own, Matterson was eyeing Gleazen's with a
show of keener interest.</p>

<p>"Let me carry your bundle, Neil, you with a hole in
your leg," he said.</p>

<p>"No," Gleazen replied.</p>

<p>"I'll never notice the weight of it."</p>

<p>"Keep your hand off, Molly. I'll carry my own bundle."</p>

<p>"As you please."</p>

<p>Matterson turned away and stepped to one side.</p>

<p>All this I noticed, at first, mainly, if the truth be known,
because I saw how closely Arnold Lamont was noticing it,
but later because the manner of the two men convinced me
that Gleazen's pack held the bag that the others were so
carefully guarding.</p>

<p>Now that our food was almost gone, there remained so
very little baggage of any kind for us to carry, that there
was no good reason that I could see for not putting our
odds and ends of clothing and ammunition into, say, two
convenient bundles, at which we could take turns during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
our forced march to the river, or, indeed, for not abandoning
the mere baggage altogether. But Gleazen, Matterson,
and O'Hara had planned otherwise. Having allotted
to each of us his share of the food that remained, and an
equal seventh of our various common possessions, they
kept three of the muskets themselves, and gave the fourth
to poor Seth Upham, which seemed to me so mad an act
that I was on the point of questioning its wisdom, when
Arnold caught my eye and signaled me to be still.</p>

<p>Gathering in the door of the hut, we looked out into the
silent, moonlit glade that led down the hill and through
the valley toward the distant river.</p>

<p>"Are we all ready, lads?" Matterson asked in his light
voice.</p>

<p>"Push on, Molly, push on," Gleazen replied.</p>

<p>Shouldering his pack, Matterson stepped out into the
moonlight. "Now, then," he whispered,&mdash;for although
we were confident that no enemy within earshot was then
awake (it had not been hard for O'Hara to persuade us to
his own way of thinking), a spell of silence and secrecy was
upon us,&mdash;"it's straight for the river, lads, and the devil
take the hindermost. If you're too lame to travel, Neil, so
help me, I'll carry you."</p>

<p>"Push on!" Gleazen returned hoarsely. "Push on to
the spring. After that we'll talk if you wish."</p>

<p>"We're going home," I thought. Home, indeed! It
seemed that at last we had turned the corner; that at last
we had passed the height of land and were on the point of
racing down the long slope; that at last our troubles were
over and done with. A score of figures to express it leaped
into my mind. And first of all, best of all, at last we were
to get water!</p>

<p>Arnold said sharply, "Come, Abe; come, Joe; step
along."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>Bending low, Matterson led the way, I followed close
at his heels, and the others came in single file behind
me. Seven dark figures, silently slipping from shadow to
shadow, we left behind us the hut,&mdash;we believed forever!&mdash;and
headed straight down the hill to the spring; for more
than anything else we longed to plunge our faces into cold
water and drink until we had quenched our burning thirst.</p>

<p>Down the hill to the spring we went, slipping along in
single file. All night and all day, without a word, we had
endured agony; for it was by showing no sign of life whatever
to those who were guarding the hut from the forest
that we hoped so to lull their watchfulness that we could
escape them just after midnight. And now we were eager
almost beyond words for that water which we had so vividly
imagined. As we darted into the tall grass, it seemed
so completely assured that I swung my pack from my
shoulder and broke into a quick trot after Matterson,
whose long, swift strides, as he straightened up, had carried
him on ahead of me.</p>

<p>If a thousand people read this tale, not one of them,
probably, will know the full meaning of the word thirst;
not one will understand what water had come by then to
mean to me.</p>

<p>I ran&mdash;I tried to run faster&mdash;faster! But as I dragged
my pack along, bumping at my knees, I was amazed
to see Matterson stop. He threw his musket to his shoulder.
The hollow boom of it went rolling off through the
woodland and echoed slowly away into silence among the
mighty trees. Then he threw his hands up, and with a cry
fell into the grass, and lay so still that I could not tell
where he had fallen.</p>

<p>By the flash of his musket I and those behind me had
for an instant seen by the spring a grotesque figure dressed
in skins and rags, and painted with white rings and bars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
When the flash died away, we could see nothing, not even
the waving grasses and the black trees against the sky, because
momentarily the sudden glare had blinded us.</p>

<p>As if impelled by another will than mine, I drew back
step by step until I was standing shoulder to shoulder
with the others. Whatever quarrels we had had among
ourselves were for the time forgotten.</p>

<p>"Now, by heaven," Gleazen gasped, "it's back to the
hut for all of us!"</p>

<p>"But Neil&mdash;now, Neil, sure now we can't run away
and leave old Molly," O'Hara cried.</p>

<p>"Leave him?" Gleazen roared. "We've got to leave
him! Where is he? Tell me if you can! Go find him if
you like! Hark! See!"</p>

<p>With a thin, windy whistle a spear came flying out of
the night and passed just over Gleazen's shoulder and his
pack. Another with a soft <i>chug</i> struck into the ground at
my feet; then, my eyes having once more become accustomed
to the moonlight, I saw sneaking into the clearing a
score of dark, slinking figures.</p>

<p>"They're coming!" I cried. "They're cutting us off!
Quick! Quick!" In panic I started back to the hut, with
the others at my heels.</p>

<p>When they saw the figures that I had seen, Gleazen and
O'Hara both fired their muskets, whereupon the figures
disappeared and we, deafened by the tremendous reports
and blinded again by the bright flashes, ran back as hard
as we could go to the hut that so short a time since we had
eagerly abandoned; and with Gleazen limping in the
rear, fairly threw ourselves across the threshold.</p>

<p>Whether our gunfire had done any real damage, we
gravely doubted; and now we were both a man and a
weapon short. But bitterest of all, and by far the most
discouraging, was our intense thirst.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, the black devils," O'Hara muttered between grinding
teeth. "Sure, and they planned all that&mdash;planned to
let us get the water almost between our lips and then drive
us back here. The black cowards, they dare not meet us
man to man, though they are forty to our one."</p>

<p>It was significant that no one spoke of Matterson. The
silence as regarded his name marked a certain fatalism,
which now possessed us&mdash;something akin to despair, yet
not so ignoble as despair; something akin to resolution,
yet not so praiseworthy as resolution. There seemed, indeed,
nothing to say about him. Bull was dead, I thought,
and Matterson was dead; and even if the blacks dared not
rush upon us and take the hut by storm, they would soon
kill us by thirst. We had done our best; if worst came to
worst, we would die with our boots on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile queer low cries out in the forest were rising
little by little to shrill yells and hoots and cat-calls. If we
could judge by the sounds, there were hundreds of blacks,
if not thousands.</p>

<p>"O Bull! You poor, deluded fool!" O'Hara cried.
"Now why&mdash;why&mdash;<i>why</i> did he go and build the house
on a king's grave?"</p>

<p>Why indeed?</p>

<p>It was a fearful thing to hear those cries and yells; yet,
although we watched from door and windows a long while,
we did not actually see any further sign of danger, until
Arnold Lamont, who was guarding the door, said in a subdued
voice, "Look&mdash;down the hill&mdash;half-way down.
Something has moved twice."</p>

<p>As we gathered behind him, he turned and with a quick
gesture said, "Do not leave the windows. Who knows
what trick they may try upon us?"</p>

<p>My uncle, who seemed for the moment to comprehend
all that was going forward, and Abe Guptil and Gleazen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
went back to the windows, although it was evident enough
that their minds were not so much on their own duty as on
whatever it was that had caught Arnold's attention.</p>

<p>"See!" said Arnold.</p>

<p>There was nothing down there now that seemed not to
belong by nature to the place, and I surmised that Arnold
had seen only some small animal. But that a black object,
appearing and disappearing, had revealed more to the
others than to me, I immediately apprehended.</p>

<p>"It was fifty feet farther down the hill when I first distinguished
it," said Arnold.</p>

<p>O'Hara went over to my uncle and I heard him say,
"Let me take your gun, since it's loaded, Mr. Upham,
and thank you kindly."</p>

<p>Returning, he sat down in the door beside Arnold, who
had begun meanwhile to load the empty musket that
O'Hara had carelessly laid aside. When the thing, whatever
it was, moved again, O'Hara raised the gun to his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" Arnold whispered.</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>The thing moved once more.</p>

<p>"Will ye look, now! It's come ten feet in this direction,"
O'Hara whispered.</p>

<p>Now Arnold raised his own musket.</p>

<p>Again we saw the thing, but so briefly that neither Arnold
nor O'Hara had time to fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly O'Hara laid his hand on Arnold's shoulder and
repeated Arnold's own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't shoot."</p>

<p>"This time," Arnold whispered, "I shall shoot."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, wait a bit!" O'Hara gently pressed down
the muzzle of the gun.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you must understand, the yelling and hooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
had first grown loud and near, then had drawn slowly
farther away. It was not easy to let that creature, be it
animal or human, come crawling up the hill in the full
light of the moon. As the cries died in the distance, the
thing moved faster and with less concealment, and I
fiercely whispered, "Shoot, Arnold, shoot!"</p>

<p>"Wait," he replied and lifted a restraining hand.</p>

<p>At the moment I could not understand why he did not
do as I said; but as the thing came out into open ground,
the same thought that had caused the two to hold their
fire occurred likewise to me; and now we saw that we were
right.</p>

<p>The thing crawling up the hill was a man, and when the
man came into the open clearing directly in front of our
camp, we saw that it was Matterson.</p>

<p>Without a word, followed closely by O'Hara, who laid
his gun on the threshold, I leaped out past Arnold and ran
down to Matterson and helped him to his feet and led him
groaning up to the hut.</p>

<span class="small">SPEARS IN THE DARK</span></h3>

<p>"O-o-oh!" he moaned. "They got me. It's a wonder
they didn't kill me. But here I am along with old Neil
Gleazen."</p>

<p>"Where's your bundle?" Gleazen demanded.</p>

<p>"Down in the grass by the spring."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, Matterson, it's good I carried my
own."</p>

<p>Matterson repressed another groan and made no answer.</p>

<p>Blood was running from a great gash above his ear and
across his cheek, which we hastened to bind to the best of
our ability, and he lay down on the floor with his head on
his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm on the sick list," he said at last, "but I've had
water, and if those black sons of hell have not poisoned the
spring, I'll call it quits."</p>

<p>Matterson's face was a ghastly sight, and already blood
had reddened the strip of sacking round his head; but I
believe there was not a man of us who would not have
taken his wound to have got his chance at water.</p>

<p>"If only we could catch a king," Gleazen remarked
thoughtfully. "That's the way to end a war in Africa.
Catch us a king and make peace on him."</p>

<p>"That's one way surely to end a war," said O'Hara,
darkly, "but not this war."</p>

<p>"And why not this war?"</p>

<p>"Because," said O'Hara, "Bull built the house on a
king's grave. It's the <i>spirits</i> that are offended."</p>

<p>Gleazen laughed unkindly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, laugh," cried O'Hara, "that's all you know about
spirits. Now I'll tell ye, believe me or not as it pleases ye,
that the spirit of a nigger is a bad thing to cross. And care
as little as ye please for jujus and fetishes and nigger gods,
the times are coming when they'd serve you well if you'd
not turned them off by laughing at them."</p>

<p>"Spirits&mdash;" said my uncle in an undertone. "Hm!
Hollands, Scotch, and Rye. We must lay in more Hollands,
Sim; the stock's getting low. And while you are
about it, we'd best take an inventory of our cordials."</p>

<p>Gleazen fluently swore, and watched Seth Upham with
a keen, appraising look. There was no doubt that in his
own wandering mind my uncle was back again in his store
in Topham.</p>

<p>"I'm thirsty," he said suddenly. "I must get a drink
of water. Now where's the bucket? Sim, where's the
bucket?"</p>

<p>As he fumbled along the wall, we stared at one another
with eyes in which there was fear as well as horror. I
swallowed hard. Poor, poor Uncle Seth, I thought. What
was to become of him? And indeed, for the matter of that,
of us all?</p>

<p>By this time I had come to see clearly that poor Seth
Upham was in no condition to stand up for his own rights,
and that, whether or not he could stand up for his rights,
he had no chance of getting them from that precious trio,
his associates, without a stronger advocate than mere
justice.</p>

<p>They had promised unconditionally that half the profits
of their mad voyage should be his, and by that promise
alone they had so cruelly persuaded him to sell home and
business and embark in their enterprise. Now, deceived,
bullied, flouted, he bade fair to lose not only those gains
which were rightfully his, but also his vessel, his stores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and every cent that he had ventured. If there was to
be a copper penny saved for him, Arnold, Abe, and I must
save it.</p>

<p>Through the rough, less pleasant memories of his abrupt,
sharp ways&mdash;and so often, even when he was in the
abruptest and sharpest of moods he had betrayed unconsciously,
even unwillingly, his thought of my future, for
which he was building, as well as for his own&mdash;there came
memories of old days, when he and my mother and I had
lived so quietly and happily together in Topham.</p>

<p>I started up, all at once awakened from my reveries,
with Abe's dazed voice ringing in my ears. "Look!
Look!" he cried. "Look there!"</p>

<p>For the moment, in our horror at my uncle's condition,
we had almost forgotten our danger from without.</p>

<p>"Look!" Abe cried again. "In heaven's name look
there!"</p>

<p>We crowded shoulder to shoulder by the window where
Abe had stationed himself and saw in the moonlit clearing
a strange creature, which came dancing and rolling along
from the edge of the forest. It was dressed in skins and
rags. It was painted with big white rings and bars. Now
it began to utter strange whines and squeals and whimpers,
in an unearthly tone that it might have produced by
blowing on a split quill.</p>

<p>From the corner of my eye I saw that Matterson was
biting his lip. At my side I felt O'Hara violently trembling.</p>

<p>Out in the moonlight, where the swaying creepers cast
dim, spectral shadows, the gibbering, murmuring creature
was coming nearer. Its boldness was appalling. I had
been brought up in a Christian country and given a Christian
education, but even to me that clumsy, dancing
wizard, with his unearthly squeals and cries, brought a
superstitious fear so keen that I could scarcely control my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
wits. Small wonder that such tricks impose on credulous
savages!</p>

<p>"Watch, now!" Gleazen said quietly. He leveled a
musket across the window-sill. "Spirits is it? I'll show
them."</p>

<p>"Don't shoot," O'Hara cried. "Don't shoot, Neil, don't
shoot!"</p>

<p>He reached past me toward Gleazen; but before he
could lay hands on the gun, Gleazen fired. A spurt of
flame shot from the muzzle, and as the report went thundering
off into the forest the medicine man&mdash;wizard&mdash;devil&mdash;call
him what you will&mdash;seemed curiously to wilt
like a drought-killed plant, but more suddenly than ever
plant wilted, and fell in a crumpled heap in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"You fool!" O'Hara cried, "you cursed fool! First it
was Bull that built the house on a king's grave and now
it is you that's killed a devil!"</p>

<p>"He's dead enough," Gleazen calmly replied.</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Here and there, along the edge of the forest, men darted
into the moonlight. They carried spears, which flashed
now and then when the moon fell just so on the points.
First they gathered by the body of the wizard and carried
it back into the woods. We saw them, a little knot of men
with the heavy weight of the fallen mummer in their
midst, moving slowly to the wall of vines and through it
into the mysterious depths beyond. Then, coming slowly
out again, they moved back and forth before the hut as if
to appraise our chances of defending it. Then they once
more disappeared.</p>

<p>All this time they had walked as if in a world of death.
Although we had seen their every gesture, we had not
heard a sound loud enough to rival the almost imperceptible
drone of insects in the grass. But now we heard again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
that grimly familiar, haunting, wild cry. Three times we
heard it, terribly mournful and prolonged; then we heard
a voice wailing, "White man, I come 'peak: white man all
go Dead Land."</p>

<p>The voice died away, a few formless shrieks and yells
followed it, and a silence, long and deep, settled upon the
clearing.</p>

<p>Once more Arnold, Abe, and I stood on one side of the
hut, and Gleazen, Matterson, and O'Hara on the other,
with poor Seth Upham wandering aimlessly between us.</p>

<p>There was war within and without. There was almost
no food. There was no water at all. I thought, then, that
I should never see the town of Topham again; and&mdash;which
oddly enough seemed even harder to endure&mdash;I
thought that I never again should see the mission on
the river.</p>

<p>"I swear," O'Hara whispered,&mdash;so clearly did I hear
the words, as I stood with one eye for the inside of the
hut and one for the outside, that I jumped like a nervous
girl,&mdash;"I swear we've started a war that will reach from
here to Barbary before it's done. Hearken to that!"</p>

<p>We heard afar off the throbbing of native drums, the
roar of distant angry voices, a strange chant sung in some
remote African encampment.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="small">CARDS AND CHESS</span></h3>

<p>Hunger and thirst were stripping away the last vestige
of our pretended good-will, and our two parties glared at
each other in a sullen rage, which seemed visibly to grow
more intense, until it was the most natural thing in the
world that Arnold should touch with the toe of his shoe a
board that ran from one end of the hut to the other and
divided the floor approximately into halves.</p>

<p>"That side," he said, "is yours. This side is ours. You
shall not cross that line. You shall guard the hut from
that side; we, from this."</p>

<p>Gleazen looked at Matterson, then at O'Hara, then
both he and Matterson nodded grim assent.</p>

<p>But although a board across the hut divided us into two
hostile camps, we shared a peril so imminent and so overwhelming
that we dared not for an instant relax our watchfulness
toward our enemies in the forest.</p>

<p>With one eye on our foes without and one on our foes
within, we settled ourselves for another night, which I remember
by the agonies of thirst that we endured; and
with a certain grim confidence, shared by both parties in
the hut, that neither would betray the other, since to do
so would be to throw away its own one chance for life, we
watched and waited for the dawn.</p>

<p>And meanwhile we heard in the forest such a clamor
and din as few white men have ever been so unlucky as to
hear. First, we heard unseen people running about and
furiously screaming; then, here and there through the
trees and vines we caught glimpses of flaming torches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
which they swung in great circles and again and again
touched to the ground. I was convinced that it preluded
an attack, and I screwed up my courage and fingered my
pistols and tried not to show my fear; but in a brief lull I
learned from something that O'Hara was saying to his
companions that they were not preparing for an attack;
they were mourning for the wizard whom Gleazen had
killed, and with the flaming torches they were driving
away evil spirits. Now far down the valley we caught
glimpses of moving lights; and once in a while, through
pauses in the nearer din, we heard a distant droning, by
which we knew that the blacks of the countryside were
converging upon us from the remotest districts, along their
narrow trails, in thin streams like ants. Minute by minute
the cries became more general, and rose to such a
hideous intermingling of wails and shrieks as I should not
have believed could issue from merely human throats.</p>

<p>By its volume and extent the uproar was an appalling
revelation of the number of those who had surrounded us,
and I tell you that we seven men in that hut in the clearing
were properly frightened. It seemed a miracle that
they did not sweep over us in one great irresistible wave
and bear us down and blot us out. Yet such was their superstitious
fear of things they did not understand, that
from the cover of our frail little hut our few firearms still
held them at a distance.</p>

<p>Never dreaming that their own power was infinitely superior
to ours, attributing the death of their wizard to a
witchcraft stronger than his own, they circled round and
round us under cover of the forest and dared not come
within gunshot.</p>

<p>As day broke, and the sun rose like a ball of fire and
blazed down on us and doubled the tortures that we had
suffered in the night, we heard the drummers who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
come to pound their drums by the body of the dead wizard.
The drumming throbbed and rolled in waves; bells
rang and hands clapped; and all the time there was shrieking
and wailing and moaning.</p>

<p>They drummed the stars down and the sun up, and
when at noon there had been no respite from the din,
which by then fairly tortured us, the other three, who had
been talking together among themselves, called us to the
board across the hut for conference.</p>

<p>"Now, men," O'Hara began, "we'll make no foolish
talk of being friends together; surely we and you know
how much such talk is worth. But we and you know,
surely, that if one party of us is killed, the others will be
killed likewise; for we are too few to fight for our lives,
even supposing as now that every man jack of us is alive
and bustling. Is not that so?</p>

<p>"Now, lads, there's a chance we can break through
their line and run for the river while the niggers is praying
and mourning over that corpse yonder."</p>

<p>O'Hara stopped as if for us to reply, and I glanced at
Arnold, who, meeting my glance, turned to Abe Guptil
and thoughtfully said, "Shall we take that chance, Abe?"</p>

<p>"Take any chance, is my feeling, Mr. Lamont. Chances
are all too few."</p>

<p>With a nod at O'Hara, Arnold replied, "We are agreed,
I think. As you say, there is a chance. You three shall go
first. We will follow."</p>

<p>"It's a chance," O'Hara repeated, almost stubbornly.</p>

<p>"We are in a mood for chances," Arnold returned.
"But you three must go first."</p>

<p>When O'Hara frowned, hesitated, and acceded, I wondered
if he thought we were gullible enough to let them
come behind us.</p>

<p>Arnold was quietly smiling, but the others, as they gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
in the door, were grave indeed. There was not one of
us who did not know in his heart that our hope was utterly
forlorn. Only Arnold&mdash;time and again I marveled
at him!&mdash;sustained that amazing equanimity.</p>

<p>Gleazen shouldered his pack, but the others let theirs lie.</p>

<p>"How about the rest of the baggage?" Arnold asked, as
composedly as if he were setting out from the store in
Topham upon a two days' journey.</p>

<p>"Leave it to the devils and the ants," Matterson thickly
retorted.</p>

<p>Both he and Gleazen were lame from their wounds and
must have suffered more than any of the rest of us. How
they could face the long, forced march, I did not understand;
for though hunger and thirst were my only troubles,
my head swam when I moved quickly and my limbs were
now very light, now heavier than so much lead. But
Gleazen had long since shown his mettle, and Matterson,
although he staggered when he walked, set his teeth as he
leaned against the wall and waited to start.</p>

<p>If the truth were told, we had no real hope of getting
away; and immediately whatever desperate dreams we
clung to were frustrated; for, as we appeared in front of
the hut and weakly started down the hill, there came a
sudden lull in the mad wailing over the dead wizard; black
warriors appeared on all sides of us, and a line of them,
like hornets streaming out of their nest, emerged from the
forest and massed between us and the spring.</p>

<p>"Come, men, it's back to the house," said O'Hara; and
back we went, each party to its own side as before, but
each turning to the others as if for what pitiful mutual reassurance
there could be in such a situation.</p>

<p>"There's war from here to the coast," Matterson muttered.
"Such a war as never was before."</p>

<p>The voice that issued from his dry throat was so thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and husky that I should never have known it for the light,
effeminate voice of Matterson.</p>

<p>"It's bad," said Gleazen, "but so help me, they'll be
cleaning out old Parmenter and putting an end to the
sniveling psalm-singers on this river. And then, lads! Ah,
then'll be great times ahead, if once we get free and clear
of this accursed hornets' nest."</p>

<p>In the face of our desperate danger, the man was actually
exultant. But I thought of the girl at the mission, and
a dread filled my heart, so strong that the room went black
and I sat down, literally too sick to stand.</p>

<p>With never a word poor Uncle Seth was pacing back and
forth across the hut. Of us all, he alone had the liberty of
the entire place; but it was a tolerant, contemptuous liberty
that the others gave him, and nothing else would
have testified so vividly to the way he had fallen in their
regard.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that this pale, gaunt, voiceless
man, who suffered so much in silence, who without comment
or remark let matters take their own course, who
resented no indignity and aspired to no authority, could
be that same Seth Upham who had made himself one of
the leading men of our own Topham. And indeed it was
not the same Seth Upham! Something was broken; something
was lost. In my heart of hearts, I knew well enough
what it was, but I could not bear to put the thought into
words. No man in my place, who had a tender regard for
old times and old associations, could have done so.</p>

<p>There had been no life at all in our last attempt to leave
the hut. We faced the future now in the listlessness of
despair. Still the extraordinary situation continued unchanged.
Apparently, so long as we remained in the hut,
we were to be ignored. It seemed as if the black fiends
must know how bitterly we were suffering as hour after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
hour the clamor of their mourning rose and fell; as if they
were deliberately torturing us.</p>

<p>When Matterson sat down on the floor with his back
against the wall, and began to whittle out bits of wood
from one of the legs of the table, I watched him with an
inward passion that I made no effort to control. He, for
one, was responsible for Seth Upham's sad plight, but
with a heart as hard as the blade of his knife he calmly sat
for hours whittling, and smiling over his work.</p>

<p>All that day we heard the tumult in the forest; all that
day the sun blazed down on the hut and doubled and
trebled the tortures of our thirst; all that day Seth Upham
paced the hut in silence; and from noon till late afternoon
Matterson whittled at little sticks of wood.</p>

<p>Piece by piece there grew before our eyes a set of chessmen.
Rough and crude though the men were, they
slowly took the familiar shapes of kings and queens and
bishops and knights and pawns. When they were done,
Matterson hunted through the pockets of the coat that
the skeleton still wore, and found a carpenter's pencil,
with which he blackened half the men. Then, grunting
with pain as he moved, he drew a crude chessboard on the
floor squarely in the middle of the hut.</p>

<p>"Lamont," said he, "shall we play?"</p>

<p>Arnold smiled. "I will play you a game," he said.</p>

<p>And with that the two sat down by the board and tossed
for white and set up the crudely carved men, and began
perhaps the most extraordinary game of chess that ever
two men played.</p>

<p>There was something admirable in their very bravado.
While the rest of us watched the clearing, every man of us
suffering from thirst and hunger, the tortures of the
damned, those two, swaying sometimes from sheer weakness,
played at chess as coolly as if it were one of the games<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
that Arnold and Sim had played of old in my uncle's store
at Topham; and although to this day I have never really
mastered chess, I knew enough of it to perceive that it was
no uneven battle that they fought. As the pawns and
knights advanced, and the bishops deployed, and the
queens came out into the board, the two players became
more and more absorbed in their game, which seemed to
take them out of themselves and to enable them to forget
all that had happened and was happening.</p>

<div class="p2 figcenter">
<img src="images/illus_0388.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="Playing chess" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>And with that the two sat down by the board ... and began perhaps the
most extraordinary game of chess that ever two men played.</i></p>

<p>Indeed, it well-nigh hypnotized those of us who were
only watching. The ghastly calm of the two, the fierceness
with which they fixed their eyes on each move, the coolness
with which they ignored the wild clamor, all helped
to compose the rest of us, and by their example they made
us ashamed of revealing to one another the fears we were
struggling against.</p>

<p>"Neil," said O'Hara suddenly,&mdash;his harsh, hoarse
voice startled even the chess-players,&mdash;"shall we have a
turn at cards? I do believe there's a wonderful solace in
such hazards."</p>

<p>"Cards!" Gleazen echoed. His own voice was stranger
than O'Hara's. "We have no cards."</p>

<p>From the pocket of the blue coat on the skeleton O'Hara
drew out a dingy old pack, which a dead man's fingers had
placed there.</p>

<p>"Sure, and I know where to find them," he said. "Never
did Bull travel without them."</p>

<p>With that the two squatted on the floor, and shuffled
the cards with a pleasant whir, and dealt and played and
dealt again.</p>

<p>It was as if our party had suddenly been transported
back to Topham. Such nonchalance was almost beyond
my understanding. Matterson, by his cool, bold defiance
of danger, seemed to have aroused emulation in every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
of us; and Gleazen, always reckless, now talked as lightly
and gayly of the games as if it were a child's play to while
away the dull hours of a holiday afternoon.</p>

<p>For the time, abandoning the agreement that neither
side should trespass on the other's half of the hut, Abe and
I watched from window to window lest the blacks take us
by surprise, and now and then we would see someone observing
the hut from under the trees a long gunshot away.
But although the wails and yells and moans and the constant
drumming over the dead wizard never ceased, no
man came from the cover of the vines into the clearing.</p>

<p>Now Arnold precisely and clearly said, "Check."</p>

<p>Matterson swore and snapped his fingers and moved.</p>

<p>Again Arnold moved, and again he said, "Check!"</p>

<p>Matterson bent over the board and frowned. After a
long delay he moved once more.</p>

<p>Instantly Arnold moved again and in his calm voice repeated,
"Check!"</p>

<p>Matterson looked up at him with a strange new respect
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You win!" he cried with an oath. "You've done well.
I didn't think you could. You <i>are</i> a chess-player."</p>

<p>"I have played a good deal," Arnold quietly replied.</p>

<p>"You have played with better men than Sim Muzzy."</p>

<p>"Yes." For a moment Arnold hesitated, then he added:
"I have beaten at chess a great man. It was like to have
cost me my sword and my head."</p>

<p>"Your sword?" Matterson repeated slowly. "Your
sword and your head?"</p>

<p>There was a question in his voice, but Arnold did not
answer it. Returning a curt, "Yes," as if regretting that
he had said so much, he brushed Matterson's chessmen
together, and looked out of the door and down the long
slope at the tall green grass beside the spring, which seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
as far away from us as did our own well, thousands of miles
away in Topham.</p>

<p>And still Gleazen and O'Hara played on. Time and
again we heard the whir of shuffling and the slap of cards
flung on top of one another.</p>

<p>Now the sun was setting. The swift twilight came upon
us and faded into darkness, and the card-players also
stopped their game.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="small">AN UNSEEN FOE</span></h3>

<p>All day Seth Upham had scarcely said a word. From
dawn until dark he had paced the hut, apparently buried
deep in thought. Only his gaunt, pitiful face revealed
the extent to which he shared our tortures.</p>

<p>Now for the first time in all that day, to our surprise, he
spoke; and his first words confirmed every fear we had felt
for him.</p>

<p>"The boys ought not to make so much noise," he said.
"I must speak to the constable about it."</p>

<p>Matterson softly swore and shifted the bandage on his
face. Gleazen significantly looked over at me. Abe Guptil
stood with his mouth open and stared at Seth Upham.</p>

<p>Never boys of a New England town made such an uproar
as was going on outside. Those wails and yells and
hideous drummings and trumpetings were African in every
weird cadence and boisterous hoot and clang.</p>

<p>Then, as if the first words had broken a way through his
silence, Seth Upham began to talk in a low, hurried voice;
and however reluctant we had hitherto been to believe
that he was mad, there was no longer any hope for him at
all. The man had lost his mind completely under the terrific
strain that he had endured.</p>

<p>Small wonder when you think of all that had happened:
of how, for Cornelius Gleazen's mad project, he had thrown
away a place of honor and assured comfort back in Topham;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">of how he had been driven deeper and still deeper</span><br />
into Gleazen's nefarious schemes by blackmail for we
knew not what crimes that he had committed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
young-manhood; of how, even in that alliance of thieves,
he had fallen from a place of authority to such a place
that he got not even civil treatment; of how he had lost
reputation, livelihood, money, and now even his vessel.</p>

<p>"I declare, we must put in another constable," he muttered.
"Johnson can't even keep the boys in order&mdash;In
order, did you say? Who else should keep the place in
order?&mdash;O Sim, if only you had wits to match your good
intentions! How can you expect to keep books if you can't
keep the stock in order?&mdash;" He stopped suddenly and
faced the door. "Hark! Who called? I declare, I thought
I was a lad again."</p>

<p>Moment by moment, as he paced the hut, we watched
his expression change with the mood of his delirium,&mdash;sometimes
I have wondered if the fever of the tropics did
not precipitate his strange frenzy,&mdash;and moment by moment
his emotions seemed to become more intense.</p>

<p>Now, pursuing that latest fancy, he talked about his
boyhood and told how deeply he repented of the wicked
life he had led as a young man; told us, all unwittingly, of
unsuspected ambitions that had led him from wild ways
into sober ones, and of his youthful determination to win
a creditable place in the community; told us of the hard
honest work that he had given to accomplish it. Now he
revealed the pride he had taken in all that he had succeeded
in doing and building, and&mdash;which touched me
more than I can tell you&mdash;how he had counted on me,
his only kinsman, to take his place and carry on his work.
All this, you understand, not as if he were talking to us or
to anyone else, but as if he were thinking out loud,&mdash;as
indeed he was,&mdash;merely running over in his own mind
the story of his life.</p>

<p>Now he reverted again to his repentance for the wicked
youth that he had lived. And now, suddenly, his manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of speaking changed, and from merely thinking aloud he
burst out into wild accusation.</p>

<p>"The dice are loaded," he cried,&mdash;his voice was hoarse
and strained with the agonies that he, like all of us, had
endured and was still enduring,&mdash;"the dice are loaded.
I'll not play with loaded dice, Neil Gleazen!"</p>

<p>At that Gleazen gasped out a queer whisper.</p>

<p>But already Seth Upham's mind was racing away on another
tack.</p>

<p>"Aye, loaded with the blessed weight of salvation.
Didn't my old mother, God bless her, teach me at her
knee that a man's soul can never die? Our Father, who
art in heaven, hallowed be thy name&mdash;"</p>

<p>Staring at him in horror, we saw that he was not blasphemous.
The words came reverently from his weak lips.
He simply was mad.</p>

<p>Suddenly in a high-pitched voice, he began to sing,</p>

<p>
"Low at Thy gracious feet I bend,<br />
My God, my everlasting friend."<br />
</p>

<p>He sang three stanzas of the hymn in a way that appalled
every one of those three men who of us all, I think, were
least easily appalled&mdash;indeed, I think that for once they
were more appalled than the rest of us; certainly none of
them had Arnold's composure or Abe's obvious, almost
overpowering sympathy for poor Seth Upham. Then he
stopped and faced about with eyes strangely aflame. In
his manner now there was all his old imperiousness and
something more, an almost noble dignity, a commanding
enthusiasm, which, whether it came from madness alone or
whether it had always been in him, got respect even from
Matterson and O'Hara.</p>

<p>"I am going to meet my God face to face at the throne
of Judgment," he cried.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first time in days that he had addressed us
directly, and he spoke with a fierce intensity that amazed
us; then, before we guessed what was in his disordered
mind, before a man of us could stop him, he stepped outside
the door and flung his arms straight out like a cross,
and with his head thrown back marched, singing, into the
darkness.</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" Gleazen gasped, "he has set sail now
for the port of Kingdom Come!"</p>

<p>We who remained in the hut, where a spell of silence
had fallen, could hear him strongly and clearly singing as
he strode down the long, dark vista toward the spring:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Lo what a glorious sight appears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To our believing eyes!</span><br />
The earth and seas are past away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the old rolling skies!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>It may seem strange to one who reads of that fearful
night that we did not rush after him and drag him back.
But at the time we were taken completely by surprise, literally
stupefied by the extraordinary climax of our days
and nights of suffering and anxiety; and even then, I
think,&mdash;certainly I have later come to believe it,&mdash;we
felt in our inmost hearts that it was kinder to let him go.</p>

<p>He went down the hill, singing like an innocent child.
His voice, which but a moment before had been pathetically
weak, had now become all at once as clear as silver.
And still the words came back from the tall grass by the
spring, where creatures ten thousand times worse than
any crawling son of the serpent of Eden lay in wait for
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Attending angels shout for joy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bright armies sing,</span><br />
Mortals, behold the sacred feet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of your descending King."</span><br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the song quavered and died away, and there came
back to us a queer choking cry; then the silence of the
jungle, enigmatic, ominous, unfathomable, enfolded us all,
and we sat for a long time with never a word between us.</p>

<p>The wailing and drumming over the body of the dead
wizard had suddenly and completely ceased. At what was
coming next, not a man of us ventured to guess.</p>

<p>Gleazen was first to break that ghastly silence. "They
got him," he whispered. For once the man was awed.</p>

<p>"No," said Arnold Lamont, very quietly, "they have
not got him. Unless I am mistaken, his madness purged
his soul of its black stains, and he went straight to the
God whose name was on his lips when he died."</p>

<p>Of that we never spoke again. Some thought one thing;
some, another. We had no heart to argue it.</p>

<p>Poor Uncle Seth! What he had done in his youth that
brought him at last to that bitterly tragic end, perhaps no
other besides Cornelius Gleazen really knew, and Cornelius
Gleazen, be it said to his everlasting credit, never told.
But for all that, I was to learn a certain story long afterward
and far away. Not one man in hundreds of thousands
pays such a penalty for blasphemous sins of his mature
years; and whatever Seth Upham had done, however dark
the memory, it had been a boy's fault, which he had so
well lived down that, when Cornelius Gleazen came back
to Topham, no one in the whole world, except those two,
would have believed it of him.</p>

<p>In that grim, threatening silence, which enfolded us like
a thick, new blanket, we forgot our own quarrel; we almost
forgot the very cause for which we had risked, and
now bade fair to lose, our lives.</p>

<p>We were six men, two of us wounded, three of us arrant
desperadoes, but all of us at least white of skin, surrounded
by a black horde that was able, if ever it knew its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
power, to wipe us at one blow clean off the face of the
earth. Now that the terrible thing which had just happened
had broken down and done away with every thought
of those trivial enmities that fed on such unworthy motives
as desire for riches, our common danger bound us, in
spite of every antagonism, closer together than brothers.
By some strange power that cry which had come back to
us when Seth Upham's song ended not only enforced a
truce between our two parties, but so brought out the
naked sincerity of each one of us, that we knew, each and
all, without a spoken word, that for the time being we
could trust one another.</p>

<p>Gleazen, always reckless, was the first to break the silence.
From the wall he took down a pewter mug, which
the dead man they called Bull had hung there. Pretending
to pour into it wine from an imaginary bottle, he
looked across it at Arnold.</p>

<p>"This is not the vintage I should choose for my toast,"
he said with a wry mouth, "but it must serve. Yes, Lamont,
it must serve." He raised the mug high. "In half
an hour we'll be six dead men. I drink&mdash;to the next one
to go."</p>

<p>Arnold coolly smiled. Pretending to raise a glass and
clink it against the mug, he, too, went through the pantomime
of drinking.</p>

<p>I was not surprised that Abe Guptil was staring at them,
his lips parted, or that his face was pale. Although drunk
only in make-believe, it was a toast to make a man think
twice. I drew a deep breath; I could only admire the coolness
of the two.</p>

<p>Yet now and then there flashed in Arnold's eye a hint of
resourceful determination such as Gleazen probably never
dreamed of, a hint of scorn for such theatrical trickery.</p>

<p>We were all on our feet now, standing together in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
silent truce, when we heard for the last time that sound,
so unhappily familiar, the long-drawn wailing cry that,
whenever the wizard spoke, had preceded and followed his
harangue. Coming from the dark forest beyond the clearing,
it brought home to us more vividly than ever the
ominous silence that had ensued since Seth Upham fell by
the spring. Then that familiar, accursed voice, faint but
penetrating, came from the wall of vines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"White man, him go Dead Land!</p>

<p>"White man, him go Dead Land!</p>

<p>"White man, him go Dead Land!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="small">THE FORT FALLS</span></h3>

<p>"Now, by the holy," O'Hara whimpered, "it's fight for
our lives, or hand them away like so many maundy
pennies."</p>

<p>"Fight, is it?" Gleazen roared. And forgetting his stiff
wounds, he sprang to his feet. "Load those guns! Name
of heaven, be quick!"</p>

<p>Why at this particular time the bawling voice of the native
should thus have called us to action is not easy to say,
for you would think that, having become familiar with it,
we should have regarded it with proverbial contempt.
But we knew that the deadlock could not last forever;
Seth Upham's fate was all too vivid in our minds; and I
really think that, in the strange voice itself, there was
more than a hint of what was to follow.</p>

<p>Forgotten now was the edict that one party should stay
on one side of the hut, the other on the opposite side.
Forgotten, even, was the bag of stones in Gleazen's pack.
Armed with every weapon that the hut afforded, we stood
behind door and window and saw a sight that appalled
the bravest of us.</p>

<p>Straight up the hill from the spring where they had
killed Seth Upham there streamed a raging black horde.
The rising moon shone on their spears and revealed the
endless multitudes that came hard at the heels of the leaders.
Their yells reverberated from wall to wall of the forest
and even, it seemed to us, to the starry sky above them.</p>

<p>As we fired on them, the streamers of flame from our
guns darted into the night and the acrid smoke drifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
back to us. But though they faltered, this time they came
doggedly on. Already in the moonlight we could distinguish
individuals; now we could see their contorted features
alive with rage and vindictiveness. That they would
take the hut by storm, there was not the slightest doubt;
nor was there a ray of hope that we should survive its fall.</p>

<p>It was a long, long way from Topham to that wattled
hut in a clearing on the side of an African hill, and in
more ways than one it was a far call from Higgleby's barn.
But it was Higgleby's barn that I thought of then&mdash;Higgleby's
barn in the pasture, with a light shining through
a crack between the boards, and a boy scaling the wall
under the window; Higgleby's barn in the dark, with
tongues of flame running out from it through the grass.
Truly, I thought in metaphor, which was rare for me, the
fire that sprang up so long ago in Higgleby's barn had already
killed Seth Upham, and now it was going to enfold
and engulf us all.</p>

<p>Then I thought of the mission on the river, and the girl
whom I had seen first among the mangroves, then in the
darkness on the mission porch. Did the war actually
reach to the coast? And would the war wipe out "old
Parmenter" as Gleazen had said? By heaven, I thought,
it would not and it should not!</p>

<p>All this, of course, takes far longer to tell, than it took
to go coursing through my mind. In the time it took to
think it out, not one black foot struck the ground; not one
left the ground. Before that racing army of negroes had
advanced another step, the answer had come to me; and
now, no longer the boy who had climbed in idle curiosity
the wall of Higgleby's barn, but a man to think and act, I
cried from my dry throat:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Out of the back window, men! O'Hara, help me brace
the door! Out of the window and over the hill!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>With an oath Gleazen cried, "He's right! They're all
coming on us up the hill! The back way's our only
chance!"</p>

<p>O'Hara, in spite of my call for help, led the way out of
the back window; but Arnold paused to jam chairs and
boards against the door; and Gleazen, ever reckless,
stooped in the darkness and picked something up. As we
sprang to the window, he came last of all, and I saw that
he, the only one to think of it in that hour of desperate
peril, was of a mind to bring his pack&mdash;the pack that had
held the thing for which we had left our homes and
crossed the seas. I saw Matterson clinging to brave Abe
Guptil's shoulder, and striving desperately, with Abe's
help, to keep pace with O'Hara, who in all this time had
not got so much as a scratch. I saw the forest wherein lay
our sole hope of safety, and terribly far off it seemed.
Then I rolled out into the moonlight, and ran as if the
devil were at my heels.</p>

<p>Almost at once I heard Gleazen come tumbling after
me, and gasp with a frightful oath that the pack had
caught and he had left it.</p>

<p>As we ran, we kept, as far as possible, the house between
us and the blacks, and so intent were they on attacking
our little citadel, that for a moment or two they overlooked
our flight.</p>

<p>We heard their cries as they battered down the door,
their eager shouts, their sudden silence, and then the fierce
yell of discovery when they saw us in the moonlight. It
occurred to me then that, but for my poor uncle's death
down by the spring, which had very likely caused them to
break their circle and gather there in the open, we should
not have had so easy a time of it when we fled over the
hill behind the hut. Weak though we were, despair was a
mighty stimulus and we ran desperately for the woods;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
but although we had got a fair start, the pack was now
yelping in full cry on our trail.</p>

<p>The pitiful futility of it all, I thought. Seth Upham was
dead&mdash;the stones were lost&mdash;we ourselves were hunted
for our lives! As I staggered after the others straight into
the wall of almost impenetrable vines, I turned in the act
of wriggling through it and let fly with my pistol. Compared
with the muskets, the pistol made a dainty little
spit of fire and sound, but it served to delay the foremost
negroes, and with our scanty hopes a little brighter for
their hesitation, I struggled on to come up with the others.</p>

<p>It was well for us, after all, that O'Hara had taken the
lead. Say what you will against him, the man knew the
country. First, guided by the general lay of the land, he
led us down the hill, through rocks and brush, straight to
a stream where we drank and&mdash;warned by Arnold Lamont
&mdash;fought against the temptation to drink more than
a tiny fraction of what we desired.</p>

<p>Revived by the plunge into water, we turned and followed
O'Hara up the stream-bed, bending low so that no
onlooker could see us, climbed a great precipitous hill
down which the stream tumbled in noisy cascades that
hid every sound of our flight, drank again, and kept on
up into the rocks away from the water. Not daring to
raise our heads above the dry bed of the rainy-season torrent
along which we now hurried, we never once looked
back down the slope up which we had toiled, panting and
puffing and reeling; but behind us, far behind us now, we
could hear the shrieks and yells of the disappointed savages,
who, having outflanked the timber into which we
disappeared, and having wasted many minutes in beating
through it, a man&oelig;uvre that their wholesome respect for
our firearms had much delayed, had now come out on the
brow of the rocky declivity leading down to the creek, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
were losing much time, if we could judge by their clamor,
in arguing which way we were likely to have gone.</p>

<p>I wonder if the whole performance to which we owed our
lives was not characteristic of the natives of the African
coast? If therein did not lie just the difference between a
people so easily led into slavery and a people that never,
whatever their weaknesses have been, have yielded to
their oppressors? It all happened long ago, and it was my
only acquaintance with black warfare; but surely we
could never thus have thrown American Indians off the
scent.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, then, that we had made good our escape
and could run straight for the river, and in my enthusiasm
I said as much. But Arnold and Abe Guptil
shook their heads, and O'Hara significantly raised his
hand. "Hark!"</p>

<p>I listened, and realized that an undertone of sound,
which I had heard without noticing it, as one hears a
clock ticking, was the rumble of drums miles and miles
away. While I listened, another drum far to the north
took up the grim throbbing note, then another to the east.
Then, mingling with the swelling voice of all the drums,&mdash;how
many of them there were, or in how many villages,
I had not the vaguest notion,&mdash;I heard human voices
down the hill on our right, and after a time other voices
down the hill on our left. I then knew that however stupid
our pursuers might seem, to reach the river was no such
easy task as I had hoped.</p>

<p>For an hour we lay hidden among the rocks, with the
world spread out before us in the moonlight. Here and
there were small points of fire, which shone as if they were
stars reflected on water,&mdash;we knew, of course, that there
was no water, and that they must, therefore, be lights of
village or camp,&mdash;and twice, at a distance of half a mile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
men passed with torches. But for the most part we lay
shoulder to shoulder, with only the moon and the twinkling
points of light to awaken our meditations.</p>

<p>I thought of Uncle Seth dead in the grass by the spring
down to which he had gone so bravely. I thought of the
hut in which, so far as we knew, still lay the skeleton and
the bag of pebbles. And while I was thinking thus, I
heard to the southeast the sound of gunshots.</p>

<p>First came several almost together like a volley, then
another and another, then two or three more, and after
that, at intervals, still others.</p>

<p>O'Hara looked first at the sky and then in the direction
of the shooting. "They're attacking a trader's caravan,"
he said. "There'll be white men in it, surely. The thing
for us to do, my lads, is to join up with them. They'll
have food."</p>

<p>"Aye, but how?" asked Gleazen.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his question,&mdash;a terribly discouraging
answer!&mdash;we heard, when we stopped to listen, coming
up to us out of the night from every side, near and far,
the throbbing of drums.</p>

<p>"Aye, 'how?'" O'Hara repeated.</p>

<p>"Can we not," I asked, "work down toward them and
break through the blacks?"</p>

<p>"The war has gone to the coast by now, and they are
attacking all comers. But it's us they're keen on the trail
of, all because Bull built his house on a king's grave and
a blithering idiot killed a devil. 'Tis true, Joe. If we
could work down toward them, come three o'clock in the
morning, it might happen even as you say."</p>

<p>There were no torches, now, to be seen; no voices were
to be heard. There were only the fixed lights shining like
stars and the steadily throbbing drums. Whether or not,
back on our trail, the blacks were still hunting for us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
we did not know; but by all signs that we could see,
they were settling quietly down for the remainder of the
night.</p>

<p>"And if it don't happen like you say," O'Hara added
as an afterthought, "we'll be nearer the river surely, and
there may be hope for us yet."</p>

<p>At that he looked at Gleazen and smiled, and Gleazen
softly laughed and nudged Matterson, at which Matterson
swore, because Gleazen's elbow had touched a wound.
Then they all three looked at one another and laughed;
and remembering the board in the centre of the hut and
the law that neither side should trespass on the part allotted
to the other, I heartily wished that we had another
such board and another such law. We had agreed upon
our truce under the stress of great danger. Take away
that danger, I thought, and there would be nothing to
keep the old coals of hate from springing into flame anew.</p>

<p>Down from the hilltop we went, slowly picking our way
among the boulders, to still another brawling stream at the
foot. There we drank and waited and reconnoitred, and
finally, convinced that we were in no immediate danger,
pushed on after our guide, O'Hara.</p>

<p>He first led us down the ravine and through a wild and
wooded country; but within two miles the sound of drums,
which had become louder and nearer, warned us of a village
ahead, and, leaving the stream, we climbed a hill,
passed through scattered patches of plantains and yams,
from which we took such food as would dull the edge of our
hunger, came down again into dense timber, worked our
way through it, and emerged at last into an open space
above a broad plain.</p>

<p>And all this long way faithful Abe Guptil had half carried,
half dragged the great body of Matterson, who
fought hard to keep up with the rest of us and strove to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
regain the strength that his wound had taken from him,
but who despite his bravest efforts, still was sadly weak.</p>

<p>As well as we could judge by the interminable drumming,
there were villages on our right and on our left and
behind us. By the stars we estimated that it was still an
hour before dawn, and by lights on the plain we guessed at
the location of the camp of which we had come in search.</p>

<p>We had already wandered so far from the road by which
we had come to the mountain, that it seemed as if only a
miracle could bring us back to the place on the river where
we had left our boat; but in that respect O'Hara was no
mean worker of miracles, for his years in Africa had given
him an uncanny judgment of direction and distance.</p>

<p>"Yonder will be the river," he said, pointing slightly to
the left; "and yonder will surely be the camp where we
heard guns firing. Below there'll be a road and the camp
will be on the road. I know this place; I've been here
before."</p>

<p>With that he once more plunged down the steep declivity
and through a growth of scrubby trees to a great
prairie, where, even as he had said, a road ran in the direction
that our journey led us. Fire not long since had
burned over the meadow, and spears of grass from fifteen
to twenty feet high had fallen across the road and tangled
and twisted so that most of the time we had to bend almost
double as we walked. But in that early morning
hour there were no travelers on the road except occasional
deer, which went dashing off through the grass; and it
crossed many streams into which we plunged our hot faces.
With water for our thirst and plantains for our hunger, we
fared on, until, just as dawn was breaking, we came in
sight of the red coals of a fire.</p>

<p>O'Hara raised his hand and we stopped. "The niggers
are ahead of us," he whispered. "Beyond the niggers will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
be the caravan surely, and beyond the caravan there'll be
more niggers."</p>

<p>"The question, then, my friends," said Arnold, slowly,
"is whether to go round them and on alone, or to go
through the blacks and take our chances on a friendly reception
from whoever is camping just ahead."</p>

<p>"That," said O'Hara, "is the question."</p>

<p>"There's no doubt but they're traders," Gleazen muttered.
"We'll have to fight before we reach the river. The
more on our side, the merrier, I say, when it comes to
fighting."</p>

<p>By our silence we assented.</p>

<p>Arnold raised his hand. "It is by surprise, gentlemen,
or not at all. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Breathing hard, we pressed closer together.</p>

<p>"Quickly, then! Together, and with speed!"</p>

<p>Arnold's voice snapped out the orders as if we were a
company of military. There was something so commanding,
so martial, in his manner and carriage, yet something
that fitted him so well and seemed so much a part of
his old, calm, taciturn, wise way, that I felt a sudden new
wonder at him, a feeling that, well though I thought I had
known him, I never had known him.</p>

<p>Then, brought all at once into action by the energy and
force of his command, as was every one of the others, I
started at the word as did they. Together we ran straight
through the camp of sleeping blacks,&mdash;so strong was
Matterson's spirit, so great his eagerness, that he now kept
pace with us almost without help,&mdash;straight past the
coals of their campfire, over the remnants of their evening
meal, over their weapons and shields strewn in the road,
and on toward their picket-line. As they woke behind us,
bewildered, and groped to learn the cause of the sudden
disorder, and realized what was happening, and started up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
with angry cries, we leaped, one after another, actually
leaped, over a black sentry nodding at his post, over a
frail barrier that they had thrown up to conceal their
movements, and charged down upon a threatening stockade
behind which lay the caravan.</p>

<p>That the caravan kept better watch than their besiegers,
we learned first of all; for even as we leaped the barricade
and came racing down the road, a gun went off in our
faces and a cry of warning called the defenders from their
sleep.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" O'Hara yelled. "We're white men!
Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>All now depended on the men of that caravan. Were
they friends or foes, honest men or thieves, we had cast
the dice, and on that throw our fate waited.</p>

<p>I heard Gleazen bellowing in Spanish and Arnold Lamont
calling in French; then up I came with Matterson
and Abe to the crude, hasty rampart of mud and grass,
and over I tumbled upon a man who cried out in amazement
and raised his gun to strike me down, only to desist
at the sight of my white face, which was no whiter than
his own. Arnold was ahead of me; Gleazen and Matterson
came in, almost at the same moment; then came Abe; and
last of all, dumb with terror, O'Hara, who had tripped and
fallen midway between the two barricades and had narrowly
escaped perishing at the hands of the negro guards.</p>

<p>In we came and about we turned, side by side with the
strange whites, and when the hostile spearmen showed
signs of rushing upon us, we gave them balls from musket
and pistol to remember us by, and they faltered and drew
back. But that the end was not yet in sight the thudding
of their drums and the growing chorus of their angry yells
unmistakably told us.</p>

<p>"Ha! Dey t'ink dey git us yet," one of the strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
cried, hearing me speak to Arnold in English. "Dis one
beeg war. Where he start, who know? Dey fight, how dey
fight! Dey come down upon us&mdash;whee! Gun, spear&mdash;when
we start we have feefty slave. Ten we loos' before
war hit us so we know and hit back. Ha! Dis one beeg
war!"</p>

<p>"How far, tell me," gasped O'Hara, "has the fighting
gone?"</p>

<p>"Leesten!" The stranger lifted his hand. "Hear dem
drum? One here&mdash;one dar&mdash;one five mile 'way&mdash;one
ten mile 'way! Oh, ev'ywhere dem drum! Hear dem
yell! How far dis war gone&mdash;dis war gone clean to Cuba!
Dis one beeg war, by damn!"</p>

<p>"Has the war," I cried, "reached the mission on the
river?"</p>

<p>"Ha! You t'ink you see dat meession, hey? Dat
meession, he fall down long since time, I'll bet. One good
t'ing dat war he do."</p>

<p>If only I had never seen the girl by the river, I thought.
If only I could have forgotten her! I turned away. Yet
even then I would not have spared one iota of my brief
memories of that girl with the strong, kind face and quiet
voice. If I never saw her again, I still had something to
hold fast. How many times, since Seth Upham went down
to die by the spring, had I thought of that girl as one of the
few people whom I should be glad to see again, and how
many times had I wished that she did not think so ill of
me!</p>

<p>"Tell me, you man, where from you come?" the stranger
now asked. "You come <i>pop</i>! So! Whee!"</p>

<p>At that Gleazen spoke in Spanish, and the man turned
like a cat taken unawares and looked at him with shrewd,
keen eyes. Then Matterson came up to them and likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
began to talk in Spanish, and others crowded round
them.</p>

<p>Arnold, after listening for a moment, drew me to one
side. "See," he murmured.</p>

<p>Following his gesture, I looked around the camp and
saw, in the middle of the clearing, thirty or forty cowering
negroes bound fast by bamboo withes. Behind them and
mingling with them were bullocks and sheep and goats.
Moving restlessly about in the light of earliest morning
were numbers of male and female slaves; and on every
side were baled hides and bundles of merchandise: ivory,
rice, beeswax, and even, it was whispered, gold.</p>

<p>"I fear, my friend," Arnold said in an undertone, "that
our hosts are more to the taste of Gleazen than of ourselves."</p>

<p>"You have heard them talking," I whispered. "Tell
me what they said."</p>

<p>"Only," replied Arnold, "that <i>we</i> have a ship and <i>they</i>
have a cargo; that it will be to our mutual advantage to
join forces."</p>

<p>I looked again at the captive negroes, and again thought
of the girl at the mission and of the evil that she had attributed
to me.</p>

<p>"To join forces," I said,&mdash;and in my excitement I spoke
aloud,&mdash;"in trading human beings? Not that!"</p>

<p>The others turned.</p>

<p>"What are you two talking about?" Matterson asked
quickly in his light voice.</p>

<p>"Of one thing and another," I replied, flushing.</p>

<p>"Come," said Gleazen, boldly, "let us <i>all</i> talk together."</p>

<p>"Dis one beeg war!" the trader cried. "To fight&mdash;eet
is all we can do. Fighting we go, da's what me, I say.
See! Sun, he come up!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"To that," said Arnold, "we all agree. We, sir, will go
with you and fight by your side."</p>

<p>"Good! Me, I's happy. You brave men. Dis one beeg
war, but we make plenty war back again."</p>

<p>Then he cried out orders in Spanish, and the camp woke
to the activities of the new day; and while some of us held
off the blacks, the rest of us ate our morning meal in the
first golden sunlight of the dawn, with a hum and bustle
of packing and harnessing and herding going on around us.</p>

<p>But all the time the drums beat, and far away we would
hear now and then calls and shouts that made the strange
trader and Gleazen and O'Hara exchange significant
glances.</p>

<p>As with loaded muskets we fell in to guard the caravan,
and the porters lifted their bundles, and the herders goaded
their beasts, and the captive negroes started hopelessly on
the road to the river, and the sudden hush of voices made
the trample of feet seem three times louder than before,
we heard guns behind us.</p>

<p>"Ha! Dose trade gun, hey?" the trader cried, and fell
into Spanish.</p>

<p>Wheeling his horse, he anxiously looked back along the
road.</p>

<p>One thing for which we had crossed the sea was lost in a
hut overrun by an army of vengeful savages. There was
no fortune left for us, I knew, unless it were a fortune
gained by bartering human souls; and at that, which lay
at the real bottom of all Neil Gleazen's schemes, my heart
revolted. What chance should we have had of saving for
Seth Upham his ship and what money was left, even if he
had lived? Small chance, I admitted.</p>

<p>All day we drove on in a forced march, leaving the war
to all appearances far behind us and stopping only at
noon, by a clear cold stream in the forest, to eat a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
meal; and at nightfall, crossing another stretch of prairie,
we came to still another forest.</p>

<p>"Here," the trader cried, "here ees one fine leetle river!
Here we camp one leetle while! Den we go&mdash;like fire&mdash;when
midnight come, mebbe we see one beeg river!"</p>

<p>That we, who had come the night before from the house
on the king's grave, were ready to rest, I can assure you.
Never in all my life have I been so heavy with weariness,
nay, with downright exhaustion, as on that evening at the
edge of that African forest.</p>

<p>The very beasts were weary after the long day's march.
The trader's horse hung its head. The bullocks and goats
and sheep plodded on before their noisy herders and
scarcely quickened their pace at thrust of goad or snap of
whip. The captive negroes, wretched creatures doomed to
the horrors of the infamous middle passage in the hold of
some Cuban or Brazilian slave-ship, wearily dragged along,
their chins out-thrust, their hands lashed behind them.
The traders' own slaves, bending under the weight of
hides and rice and ivory, stumbled as they walked, and
even the white men themselves, who had done nothing
more than ride or walk over the road, breathed hard and
showed drawn faces as they eagerly pushed on or apprehensively
looked back.</p>

<p>Into the woods we pressed, thanking in our hearts the
Divine Providence that here at least there was no throb
of drum, no howling of black heathen, no war at all. The
aisles between the great trees were cool and green and inviting.
The river rippled over rocks and suggested by its
music the luxury of bathing; fruits were to be had for the
picking, and there was no doubt in my mind that our
hosts would butcher a sheep for the evening meal.</p>

<p>Water, food, and sleep at that moment seemed more
desirable than all the dominions of Africa; and water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
food, and sleep, I was confident, were but now at hand.
Into the forest we marched, for once relaxing the watchfulness
that we had maintained since sunrise, and down
the trail to the creek that we could hear murmuring on its
way over the rocks and through the underbrush. And
there, at the end of our long day's journey, the bushes suddenly
blossomed in flame.</p>

<p>Guns boomed in our very faces. Up and down the creek
fire flashed in long spurts. The wind brought to our nostrils
the stinging smell of powder-smoke. Men and beasts
were thrown into wild confusion. In the dim light of the
forest I saw coming at us from all sides, naked men armed
with trade guns and bows and spears and lances. Louder
than the shouts and curses behind us, rang the exultant
yells before us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="small">DOWN THE CURRENT</span></h3>

<p>When I was a boy in school, I one day ran across a translation
of Homer's Iliad and carried it home and read it
afternoons for a week. During those days I lived in the
great pictures of the battles on the plains of Troy, and
though afterwards I had seldom thought of them, they had
never quite faded from my memory.</p>

<p>It was far indeed from Homer's Iliad to an ambush in an
African forest; but the fight that ensued when we walked
into that hornets' nest of black warriors nevertheless
brought Homer's story vividly to my mind. The spears,
I think, suggested the resemblance; or perhaps the wild
swiftness of the fight. First an arrow came whistling
through the air and struck one of the men on the throat
and went through his neck half the length of the shaft.
He spun round, spattering me with dark blood that ran
from a severed vein, and went down under the feet of the
bullocks without a word. Then the bullocks turned, stampeded
by the sight and smell of blood, and crowded back
upon the sheep and goats, and the porters dropped their
burdens and tried to run. O'Hara threw up his musket
and shattered the skull of a huge black who came at him
with a knife like the blade of a scythe, and, himself stooping
to pick up the knife, grappled with another and died,
shrieking, from a spear-thrust up under the ribs. Then one
of the porters hurled a bundle at a man who was about to
cut him down, and the bundle broke and a shower of yellow
gold scattered in front of us, whereupon there was a
short, fierce rush for plunder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Side by side with Arnold Lamont and Gleazen, emptying
my pistol into the crowd, I saw out of the corner of my
eye that the blacks were cutting their way into the heart
of the caravan for slaves and booty.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, that motley horde which had rushed
upon us out of the wood. Some, naked except for loin
cloths, brandished spears and howled like enraged maniacs;
some, in queer quilted armor and helmets with ostrich
plumes, clumsily wielded trade muskets; some advanced
boldly under the cover of shields and others, ranging
through the underbrush, kept up a desultory flight
of arrows. It was primitive, unorganized, ferocious war.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon dieu</i>, what a spectacle!" Arnold exclaimed; then,
"Now, my friends, quick! To the left! While the thieves
steal, we yet may escape!"</p>

<p>Up from the mle, streaked with blood and dust, now
came the trader. "All, all ees gone!" he wailed, and
waved his arms and shrieked and stamped and cursed and
jabbered on in Spanish.</p>

<p>Had our enemies been content to delay their plundering
until they had killed us all, not one of us would have escaped
to tell the true story of that bloody day. But at the
sight of a rich caravan and loose gold, the blacks, in the
twinkling of an eye, were fighting among themselves.</p>

<p>"Quick!" again cried Arnold's voice, strangely familiar
in the midst of that grotesquely unreal uproar, and as
amazingly precise as ever. "Quick, gentlemen! It is our
only chance."</p>

<p>And with that, he, Gleazen, Matterson, the trader, Abe,
and I took to our heels into the bushes. The woods behind
the line of the ambush appeared to be deserted. At
the foot of a ravine ran the creek. We crossed it by a rude
bridge of branches, hastily and silently climbed the opposite
bank, and stole off quite unobserved.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>A hundred yards farther on, at the sound of a great
thrash and clatter, we dove into the undergrowth and lay
hidden while a band of blacks tore past us to the scene of
battle. But getting hastily up as soon as they were out of
sight, we resumed our headlong retreat.</p>

<p>Every bush and tree darkly threatened us. Great rocks,
deeply clothed in moss and tumbled so together as to form
damp holes and caves, at once tempted us by their scores
of hiding-places and filled us with apprehension lest natives
might have hidden there before us. But as if we were playing
the old game of follow-my-leader, we scrambled up and
down, and in and out, and always hard ahead, until we
again heard before us a rumble of voices and pounding feet,
and a second time, desperately, flung ourselves into the
undergrowth and lay all atremble while half a hundred
naked negroes, armed with bows and clubs and spears,
came trotting, single file, like wolves, and passed us not
fifty feet away.</p>

<p>As they disappeared, and while we still dared not move,
I saw something stir not five English cubits from my face.
I caught my breath and stared at the thing. Ten feet
ahead of it; the leaves and ferns rustled, and twenty feet
ahead of it then, twitching, it disappeared. I broke out
from head to foot in sweat. Unwittingly, we had thrown
ourselves down within hand's reach of a great serpent.
Whether or not newly gorged, and so too sleepy to resent
our nearness, it moved slowly away through the quivering
undergrowth.</p>

<p>When we had put a mile between ourselves and the
plundered caravan, Matterson turned with an oath.
"Poor Bud!" he said in his hard, light voice. "At least,
we'll hear no more of jujus and devils and king's graves."</p>

<p>Gleazen shrugged and turned to the trader. "How far
is the river?" he asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mebbe one mile&mdash;mebbe two."</p>

<p>"Do you, sir, know the road?" Arnold asked.</p>

<p>The trader nodded and spread his hands as if in despair.
"Know heem? I know heem, yes! T'ree, ten, fifty
time I come with slave and ivory and hide&mdash;now all
gone! Forty prime slave all gone! Ev'ytheeng gone!"</p>

<p>Gleazen grunted.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the river," said Arnold.</p>

<p>"Heem reever go by town," wailed the trader. "Heem
beeg town! Walls so high and strong!"</p>

<p>"Ah, that is another matter," said Arnold. "But let us
go forward at all events. We may, for all that we can tell,
strike the river below the town."</p>

<p>So forward we went in the darkness, and a slow, tedious
journey it was, particularly for Abe and me, who helped
Matterson along as best we could; but we avoided the
town by the sound of drumming that issued from behind
its walls, and having helped ourselves to fruit from the
patches of cultivated land that we passed, we at last
emerged from the darkness of the woods into the half light
of a great clearing, and saw a vast, black, living surface on
which strange lights played unsteadily. It seemed unbelievable
that it really could be the same river that we
had left so long ago,&mdash;in the sense of all that had happened,
so very long ago,&mdash;and yet I knew, as I watched
Gleazen and Matterson, that it must be the same. The
black, swift current recalled to my mind the toil that we
had expended in coming so far to so little purpose. In
which direction the creek lay that we had entered on our
way to the ill-fated hut, I had not the remotest idea; but
I looked a long time downstream toward the mission.</p>

<p>Bearing around in a rough half-circle, we worked slowly
down the bank, until the walls of the town itself were before
us, at a safe distance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our boat," said Matterson, grimly, "is fifty miles
away."</p>

<p>"Wait here," said I. "There'll be canoes under the
town. I'll get one."</p>

<p>Gleazen made a motion as if to go himself, but Arnold
shook his head. "No; let Joe go first. He will learn where
the canoes are, and do it more quietly than we."</p>

<p>They all sat down by the edge of the water, and, leaving
them, I went on alone. It took all the courage I could
muster; but having rashly offered, I would not hesitate.</p>

<p>For one thing, it gave me time to think, and in a sense
I desired to think, although in another sense it came to me
that I was more afraid of my own thoughts than of all the
walled towns in Africa. The living nightmare through
which we had passed had left me worn in body and mind.
That Uncle Seth, upon whom once I had placed every confidence,
should have died so tragic a death, now brought
me a fresh burst of sorrow, as if I realized it for the first
time. It seemed to me that I could hear his sharp yet
kindly voice speaking to me of little things in our life at
Topham. I thought of one episode after another in those
earlier days, some of them, things that had happened while
my mother was alive; others, things that had happened
after her death; all, things that I had almost forgotten
long before. My poor uncle, I thought for the hundredth
time&mdash;my poor, poor uncle!</p>

<p>Then suddenly another thought came to me and I
straightened up and stood well-nigh aghast. By the terms
of my uncle's will, of which more than once he had told
me, all that had been his was mine!</p>

<p>The river silently swept down between its high banks,
past me who stood where the waves licked at my feet, past
the black walls of the town, which stood like a sentinel
guarding the unknown fastnesses of the continent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Africa, past high hill and low gravel shoal and bottomless
morass, past pawpaw and pine palm and mangrove, to the
mission and the sea.</p>

<p>There I stood, as still as a statue, until after a long time
I remembered my errand and, like one just awakened, continued
on my way.</p>

<p>I found a score of canoes drawn up on the beach under
the town, and very carefully placing paddles by one that
was large enough for our entire party, I cautiously returned
to the others and reported what I had done. Together
we all slipped silently along the shore to the canoes,
launched the one that I had chosen, and with a last glance
up at the pointed roofs of the houses and the sharpened
pickets of the stockade, silently paddled, all unobserved,
out on the strong current and went flying down into the
darkness.</p>

<p>It had been one thing to row up stream against that current.
It was quite another, and vastly easier, even though
three of us were entirely ignorant of handling such a canoe,
to paddle down the swift waters of midstream. Exerting
always the greatest care to balance the ticklish wooden
craft, which the blacks with their crude adzes had hewn
out of a solid log, we sent it, even by our clumsy efforts,
fairly flying past the trees ashore; and as it seemed that
we had struck the river many miles below the creek where
we had left our boat, we had hopes that the one night
would bring us within striking distance of the open sea.
Indeed, I found myself watching every point and bend, in
hope that the mission lay just beyond it.</p>

<p>Estimating that daylight was still two hours away, we
drew in shore at Gleazen's suggestion, to raid a patch of
yams or plantains.</p>

<p>"A man," he said arrogantly, but with truth, "can't go
forever on an empty stomach."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckless venture that it was&mdash;no sooner did the canoe
grate on the beach than a wakeful woman in a hut on the
bank set up a squealing and squalling. As we put out
again incontinently into the river, we heard, first behind
us, then also ahead of us, the roll of those accursed native
drums.</p>

<p>To this very day I abhor the sound of drumming. It has
a devilishly haunting note that I cannot escape; and small
wonder.</p>

<p>We swept on down the current, but now, here and there,
the river-banks were alive with blacks, and always the
booming of drums ran before us, to warn the country that
we were coming. Once, as we passed a wooded point, a
spear flew over our heads and went hissing into the water,
and I was all for putting over to the other bank. But Arnold,
who could use his eyes and ears as well as his head,
cried, "No! Watch!"</p>

<p>All at once, under the dark bank of the river, there was
screaming and splashing and floundering. The torches
that immediately flared up revealed what Arnold, and now
the rest of us, expected to see, but they also revealed indistinctly
another and more dreadful sight: on the shore,
running back and forth in great excitement, were many
men; but in the troubled water a negro was struggling in
vain to escape from the toils of a huge serpent, which was
wrapping itself round him and dragging him down into the
river where it had been lying in wait.</p>

<p>To me, even though I knew that that very negro had
been watching for a chance to waylay us, the sight of the
poor fellow's horrible death almost overcame me.</p>

<p>Not so with Matterson and Gleazen.</p>

<p>With a curse, Matterson cried, "There's one less of
them now." His light voice filled me with loathing.</p>

<p>And Gleazen softly laughed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>On down the river we went, with flying paddles, and
round a bend. But as we passed the bend, I looked back,
and saw coming after us, first one canoe, then two, then
six, then so many that I lost all count.</p>

<p>How far we had come in that one night, I had little or
no idea; but it was easy to see by the attitude of those
who knew the river better than I, that the end of our
journey was close at hand. Glancing round at our pursuers,
Gleazen spoke in an undertone to Matterson, and
both they and the trader studied the shore ahead of us.</p>

<p>"A scant ten miles," Gleazen muttered; "only ten miles
more."</p>

<p>I felt the heavy dugout leap forward under the fierce
pull of our paddles. The water turned away from the bow
in foam, and we fairly outrode the current. But fast
though we were, the war fleets behind us were faster. By
the next bend they had gained a hundred yards, by the
next, another hundred. We now led them by a scant quarter
of a mile, and if Gleazen had estimated our distance
rightly, they would have had us long before we could
reach port. But suddenly, all unexpectedly, round the
next bend, not half a mile away, the mission sprang into
sight.</p>

<p>There it stood, in the early morning sun, as clean and
cool and still as if it were a thousand miles away from
Africa and all its wars.</p>

<p>"Give me your pistols," Arnold cried; and when we
tossed them to him and in frantic haste resumed our
paddling, he coolly renewed the priming and one by one
fired them at our pursuers.</p>

<p>That the negroes had a gun we then learned, for they
retorted by a single shot; but the shot went wild and the
arrows that followed it fell short, and our pistols cooled
their eagerness. So we swept in to the landing by the mission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
and beached the canoe, and ran up the long straight
path to the mission house as fast as we could go, while the
black canoemen paused in midstream and let their craft
swing with the current.</p>

<p>The place, as we came rushing up to it, was so quiet, so
peaceful, so free from any faintest sign of the terrible days
through which we had passed, that it seemed as if, after
all, we had never left it; as if we were waking from a
troubled sleep; as if we had spent a thousand years in the
still, hazy heat of that very clearing. The face in the window,
the opening door, only intensified that uncanny sense
of familiarity.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the man we had seen before met
us. His eyes were stern and inhospitable.</p>

<p>"What?" said he. "Must you bring your vile quarrels
and vile wars to the very threshold of one whose whole
duty here is to preach the word of God?"</p>

<p>"Those," cried Arnold, angry in turn, but as always,
precise in phrase and enunciation, "are hard words to cast
at strangers who come to your gate in trouble."</p>

<p>"Trouble, sir, of your own brewing," the missionary retorted.
"What you have been up to, I do not know. Nor
have I any wish to save your rascally necks from a fate
you no doubt richly merit."</p>

<p>"Your words are inclusive," I cried.</p>

<p>"They certainly include you, young man. If you would
not be judged by this company that you are keeping, you
should think twice or three times before embarking with
it."</p>

<p>"Father!" said a low voice.</p>

<p>My heart leaped, but I did not turn my head. Down the
river, manned by warriors armed to the teeth, came more
canoes of the war. Behind them were more,&mdash;and more,&mdash;and
still more.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, you sniveling parson," Gleazen bellowed,
"where are your guns? Where's your powder?
Come, arm yourself!"</p>

<p>The man turned on him with a look of scorn that no
words of mine can properly describe.</p>

<p>"You have brought your dirty quarrel to my door," he
said in a grim, hard voice. "Now do you wish me to fight
your battles for you?"</p>

<p>Steadily, silently, the canoes were swinging inshore. I
saw negroes running into the clearing. On my left I heard
a cry so shrill and full of woe that it stood out, even amid
the ungodly clamor of the blacks, and commanded my
attention.</p>

<p>The man stepped down from the porch.</p>

<p>"This," he said, turning, "is a house of peace. I order
you to leave it. I will go down and talk with these men
myself."</p>

<p>"You'll never come back alive!" Matterson cried, and
hoarsely laughed.</p>

<p>At that the missionary, John Parmenter, merely smiled,
and, afraid of neither man nor devil, walked down toward
the river and fell dead with a chance arrow through his
heart.</p>

<p>There was something truly magnificent in his cold
courage, and Gleazen paid him almost involuntary tribute
by crying, "There, by heaven, went a brave man!"</p>

<p>But from the door of the house the girl suddenly ran
out. Her face was deathly white and her voice shook, but
as yet there were no tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Father!" she cried, and ran down the path, where occasional
arrows still fell, and bent over the dead man.</p>

<p>"Come up, you little fool," Gleazen shouted. "Come
back!" Then he jumped and swore, as an arrow with a
longer flight than its fellows passed above his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>The canoes were drawing in upon the shore, very cautiously,
deliberately, grimly, in a great half-moon, and
more of them were arriving at every moment.</p>

<p>I leaped from the porch and sped down beside the girl.</p>

<p>"Come," I cried, "you&mdash;we&mdash;can do nothing for
him."</p>

<p>"Is it you?" she said. "You&mdash;I&mdash;go back!"</p>

<p>"Come," I cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Don't leave him here."</p>

<p>I bent over and lifted the body, and staggering under
its weight, carried it up into the house and laid it on the
couch in the big front room.</p>

<p>All this time the noise within and without the mission
was deafening. The blacks on the river were howling with
fury, and those ashore, who had not already fled to the
woods, were wailing in grief and terror. Gleazen and Arnold
Lamont had joined forces to organize a defense, the
one raving at the arrant cowards who were fleeing from
first sight of an enemy, while the other turned the place
upside down in search of arms. And still the blacks on the
river held off, probably for fear of firearms, though there
were indications that as their numbers grew, they were
screwing up their courage to decisive action.</p>

<p>The girl, suddenly realizing the object of Arnold's
search, said quietly, "There are no weapons."</p>

<p>Arnold threw his hands out in a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"If you wish to leave," she coldly said, "there is a boat
half a mile downstream. You can reach it by the path
that leads from the chapel. No one will notice you if you
hurry."</p>

<p>"Then," I cried, "we'll go and you shall come with us."</p>

<p>Gleazen spoke to the trader in Spanish.</p>

<p>Abe Guptil was beside me now and Arnold behind me.
We three, come what would, were united.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>A louder yell than any before attracted our attention,
and Matterson, who stood where he could see out of the
window, called, "They're coming! Run, Neil, run!"</p>

<p>At that he turned and fled, with the others after him.</p>

<p>I stopped and looked into the girl's gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Come!" I cried, "in heaven's name, make haste!"</p>

<p>I had clean forgotten that the dead man by whom the
girl was standing was her father; but her next words,
which were spoken from deepest despair, reminded me of
it grimly.</p>

<p>"I will not leave him," she said.</p>

<p>"You must!"</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"What," said I, "would he himself have had you do?"</p>

<p>Her determination faltered.</p>

<p>"Come! You cannot do anything more for him!
Come."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Then I shall stay," I said.</p>

<p>"No," said she, and I saw that there was a change in
her manner toward me. "You will go and I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she whistled and cried, "Paul! Paul!"</p>

<p>The great black Fantee servant whom I had seen with
her in the canoe on that day when first we met, appeared
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Come," she said.</p>

<p>I now saw that Arnold Lamont was running back to the
door of the room.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he called. "<i>Mon dieu</i>, be quick!"</p>

<p>He stepped aside and let her go through the door first.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<span class="small">THE FIGHT AT THE LANDING</span></h3>

<p>As we ran down the footpath, we heard them after us
like hounds on the trail, and I tell you, it galled me to
run from that cowardly pack. Oh, for one good fight, I
thought! For a chance to avenge Seth Upham, who lay
miles away beside the spring at the king's grave, to avenge
the stern man who had fallen so bravely in front of the
mission! For a chance to show the black curs that we
would and could meet them, though the odds against us
were a hundred to one! A chance to hold our own with
them in defiance of their arms and numbers!</p>

<p>The hot pride of youth burned in my cheeks, and I was
actually tempted to turn on them there and then; but
now I thought of something besides myself, of something
besides Seth Upham's rights and my own: I thought of the
girl who ran ahead of me so lithely and easily. Be the hazards
what they might, be the shame of our retreat ever so
great, she must not, while one of us lived, be left to that
herd at our heels.</p>

<p>So, running thus in headlong flight, out we came on the
river bank.</p>

<p>There was a boat on the river, made fast to a peg on the
bank, and there was a long canoe drawn up in the bushes.
But at a great distance, where a narrow channel led
through the mangroves, we saw titanic waves rolling on
the bar in shining cascades from which the sun was
brightly reflected, and which, one after another, hurled ton
upon ton of water into a welter of foaming whirlpools.
And over the lifting crests of the surf we saw, standing offshore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the topsails of a brig. The prospect of riding that
surf in any boat ever built gave me, I confess without
shame, a miserably sick feeling; and as if that were not
enough, in through the mangroves to the shore in front of
us shot three canoes of the war, and cut us off from the
river.</p>

<p>Our time now had come to fight. With blacks behind us
and blacks before us, we could no longer double and turn.
The river, we knew, was alive with the canoes of the war.
Already the black hornets were swarming through the
woods and swamps around us. Three times now we had
eluded them; this time we must fight. Our guns were lost
and only pistols were left. No longer, as in that fatal hut
on the king's grave,&mdash;in my heart I cursed the bull-headed
stupidity of the man who built it and who had
paid but a fraction of the price with his own life!&mdash;could
we hold them at a distance by fear of firearms. Their
frenzy by now brooked no such fear. To the brig, whose
topsails we could descry miles off shore, we must win our
way; there lay our only hope.</p>

<p>I thought of the voice of the wizard&mdash;"White man him
go Dead Land." Verily to the door of his Dead Land we
had come; and it seemed now that we must surely follow
Bull and Seth Upham and Bud O'Hara and many another
over the threshold.</p>

<p>"Men," said Arnold Lamont,&mdash;and his voice, calm, precise,
cutting, brought us together,&mdash;"stones and clubs are
not weapons to be despised in an encounter hand to hand."</p>

<p>"Have into 'em, then!" Gleazen gasped. "All hands
together!"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Arnold, "keep close at our heels."</p>

<p>The girl was beside me now. Her eyes were wide, but
her lips were set with a courage that rose above fear.
"Come," she cried, and set my heart beating faster than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
ever, if it were possible, "they're upon us from the rear!"
Then she spoke to her great negro in a language that I had
never heard, and came close behind us when we charged
down on the blacks ahead.</p>

<p>I fired my pistol and saw that the ball accounted for one
of our enemies. I reeled from a glancing blow on the head,
which knocked me to my knees; but, rising, I lifted a great
rock on the end of a rope, which evidently the girl or her
father had used for an anchor,&mdash;never negro tied that
knot!&mdash;and swinging the huge weapon round my head,
brought down one assailant with his shoulder and half his
ribs broken. Now Arnold fired his pistol; now Matterson
pitched, groaning, into the boat. Now, with my bare
hand, I parried a spear-thrust and, again swinging my
rock, killed a negro in his tracks.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of my eye I saw that the girl had
shoved the canoe into the water. She was calling to us
eagerly, but neither I nor the others could distinguish
her words.</p>

<p>As Gleazen, with an oath, cut the painter of the boat
and leaped into her, the impulse of his jump carried her
ten feet out from shore; and instantly thrusting out the
oars, he started to row away with Matterson and desert us.</p>

<p>"Come back, you yellow cur!" Arnold cried.</p>

<p>The trader, who had fought industriously but to no
great purpose, now ran down the bank and, flinging himself
full length into the river, caught the stern of the boat,
with outstretched fingers, and dragged himself into her,
and at the same moment Abe Guptil, obviously with the
intention of holding the boat until the rest of us should
have a chance to embark, too, not of saving himself,
fought his own way aboard and, in spite of violent efforts
to lay hands on the oars, was carried, protesting, away.</p>

<p>It is not to be thought that Gleazen had the remotest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
notion of saving <i>our</i> lives. Having got rid of Arnold and
me, he could, as he very well knew, do what he pleased
with the brig when once he had silenced Gideon North.
But although he had every desire not to help us, he in
truth did help us in very spite of himself: no sooner did he
appear to be getting safely out into the river, than the
blacks, who had us all but at their mercy, suddenly bent
every effort to keep him, too, from escaping.</p>

<p>"Let them go! Let them go! Oh, will you not come this
way?"</p>

<p>It was the girl again. There was not a drop of cowardly
blood in her veins. She, in the bow of the canoe and her
big black servant in the stern, held the craft against the
bank.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the momentary respite that we got
while the enemy was putting after Gleazen, Arnold and I
fairly trembling in our haste&mdash;Arnold missed his footing
and plunged waist-deep into the river&mdash;climbed in after
them.</p>

<p>All this, which has taken a long time to tell, happened
like so many cracks of the whip. Each event leaped
sharply and suddenly at the heels of another, so that it
was really but a few seconds&mdash;at all events less than a
minute&mdash;after our arrival at the shore when we found
ourselves gliding swiftly and noiselessly through a tiny
channel among the mangroves, of which Gleazen had never
dreamed. A turn of the paddle carried us out of sight of
the struggle behind us, and it now appeared that, once out
of sight, we were likewise out of mind.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Arnold, with a manner at once so
deferential and in itself so proud, that it puzzled me more
than a little, "shall we not paddle? Permit me to take
your place."</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," she said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not fitting&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"I know the canoe, the river and the surf," she said.
"It is <i>safer</i> that I keep the paddle."</p>

<p>And to my surprise, as well as Arnold's, she did keep it
and handled it in a way that would have shamed our efforts
had we been permitted to try. It was a strange
thing in those days, when most women laced tightly, and
fainted gracefully if ever occasion required, and played at
croquet and battledore and shuttlecock, to see a slender
girl swing a paddle with far more than a man's deftness
and skill to make up for what she lacked of a man's
strength. But though she appeared so slender, so frail,
there was that in her bearing which told us that her life
in that wild place had given her muscles of steel. The big
Fantee, too, drove the long craft ahead with sure, powerful
strokes; so we shot out of the mangroves, out of the mouth
of the river, into the full glare of the sun.</p>

<p>For a time the sails of the brig had grown small in the
distance, but already we saw that she had come about and
was standing in again. Why, I wondered, did Gideon
North not anchor? Why should he indefinitely stand off
and on? How long had he been beating back and forth,
and how long would he continue to wait for us if we were
not to come? We were long overdue at the meeting-place.</p>

<p>"To think," I said, "that now we can go home to
Topham!"</p>

<p>"To Topham?" said Arnold. There was a question in
his voice. "I should be surer of going home to Topham if
we were rid of Gleazen. Also, my friend, we must ride that
surf to the open sea."</p>

<p>The negro in the stern of the canoe now spoke up in
gutturals.</p>

<p>"See!" Arnold cried.</p>

<p>Looking back up the river, we saw Gleazen and Abe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Guptil, whom we had outdistanced by our short cut, now
rowing madly downstream. Big and heavy though the
boat was, they rowed with the strength that precedes despair,
and sent her ploughing through the river with a
wake such as a cutter might have left. In the stern beside
the trader lay Matterson; and though his face, we could
see, was streaked with blood, he menaced the negroes upstream
with a loaded pistol. Arrows flew, and then a long
spear hurtled through the air and struck the bow of the
boat. But for all that, they bade fair to get clean away,
and none of them appeared aware that we had slipped
ahead of them in the race for life.</p>

<p>Now we in the canoe had come to the very edge of the
surf, where the surge of the breakers swept past us in
waves of foam. Beyond that surf was the open sea, the brig
and safety. Behind it were more terrors than we had yet
endured. For a moment the canoe hung motionless in the
boiling surge; then, taking advantage of the outward flow
and guided and driven by the hands of the great negro and
the white, slender girl, she shot forward like a living creature,
rose on the moving wall of an incoming wave, yielded
and for a brief space drew back, then shot ahead once
more and passed over the crest just before the wave curled
and broke.</p>

<p>I heard a cry from behind us and knew that the others
had discovered us ahead of them.</p>

<p>Turning, as we pitched on the heavy seas at a safe distance
from the breakers, I watched them, too, row into the
surf. I faintly heard Matterson's pistol spit, then I saw
Gleazen drive the boat forward, saw her hesitate and
swing round, lose way and go over as the next wave broke.</p>

<p>Then we saw them swimming and heard their cries.</p>

<p>As a mere matter of cold justice we should, I am convinced,
have left that villainous pair, Matterson and Gleazen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to their fate. They had been ready enough to leave
us to ours. Their whole career was sown with fraud, cruelty,
brazen effrontery, and downright dishonesty. But
even Arnold and I could scarcely have borne to do that,
for the trader was guiltless enough according to his lights,
and Abe Guptil was struggling with them in the water.</p>

<p>The girl, turning and looking back when she heard their
shouts, spoke to the great negro in his own language. The
canoe came about. Again we paused, waiting for a lull.
Then we shot back on the crest of a wave, back down upon
the overturned boat, and within gunshot of the flotilla of
canoes that were spreading to receive us.</p>

<p>As we passed the wallowing boat I leaned out and
caught Gleazen's hands and drew him up to the canoe.
The negro cried a hoarse warning, and the canoe herself
almost went over; but by as clever use of paddles as ever
man achieved, the girl and the negro brought us up on an
even keel, and Arnold and I lifted Gleazen aboard, half
drowned, and gave a hand to Abe Guptil, who had made
out to swim to the canoe. Of Matterson and the trader we
saw no sign.</p>

<p>Then Abe, himself but newly rescued, gave a lurch to
starboard, and with a clutch at something just under
water, was whipped, fiercely struggling to prevent it, clean
overboard.</p>

<p>We could neither stop nor turn; either would have been
suicide. Would we or would we not, we went past him and
left him, and drove on in the wash of the breaking waves
down upon the grim line of canoes.</p>

<p>To them we must have seemed a visitation. When I sit
alone in the dark I can see again in memory, very clearly,
that white girl, her eyes flashing, that great, black Fantee,
his bared teeth thrust out between his thick lips. The
long breakers were roaring as they swept across the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and crashed at slow intervals behind us. In those seething
waters the fiercest attack would have been futile; the very
tigers of the sea must have lain just beyond the wash of
the surf, as did the war. To one who has never seen a
Fantee on his native coast, the story that I tell of that
wild canoe-ride may seem incredible. It was an appalling,
horrifying thing to those of us who were forced passively
to endure it, who a dozen times were flung to the very
brink of death. And yet every word is true. Though I
could scarce draw breath, so swiftly did we escape one
danger only to meet another, the big black, trained from
childhood to face every peril of the coast, with the white
girl paddling in the bow, brought the canoe through the
surf and shipped no more than a bucket of water. And
then that negro and that slim girl turned in the surge, as
coolly as if there were no enemy within a thousand miles,
and started back, out again through the surf, to the Adventure.</p>

<p>Were we thus, I thought, to lose Abe Guptil, whom but
now we had rescued&mdash;good old Abe Guptil, into whose
home I had gone long since with the sad news that had
forced him to embark with us on Gleazen's mad quest?
The thunder of the seas was so loud that I could only wait&mdash;no
words that I might utter could be heard a hand's-breadth
away.</p>

<p>For a moment the canoe hung motionless on the racing
waters as a hummingbird hangs in the air, then she shot
ahead; and up from the sea, directly in her path, came a
tangle of bodies. Leaning out, Arnold and I laid hands on
Abe and Matterson; and while the negro held the canoe
in place, the girl herself reached back and caught that rascal
of a trader by the hair. Now tons of water broke
around us and the canoe half filled. Now the big negro,
by the might of his single paddle, drove us forward. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
wash of water caught us up and carried us on half a cable's
length; the negro again fairly lifted us by his great
strength; we went in safety over the crest of the next
wave, then as we drew the last of the three into the canoe,
we began to pitch in the heavy swell of the open sea.</p>

<p>With our backs turned forever on the war, we paddled
out to meet the brig. Our great quest had failed. We had
left a trail of dead men, plundered goods, and a broken
mission. But though all our hopes had gone wrong, though
Gleazen had lost all that he sought, there was that in his
face as he lay sick and miserable in the canoe which told
me that he had other strings for his bow; and when I
looked up at the brig, I vowed to myself that I would defend
my own property with as much zeal as I would have
defended my uncle's.</p>

<p>"See!" Arnold whispered. "Yonder is a strange ship!"</p>

<p>I saw the sail, but I thought little of it at the time. I had
grown surprisingly in many ways, but to this very day I
have not acquired Arnold Lamont's wonderful power to
appraise seemingly insignificant events at their true value.</p>

<p>I only thought of how glad I was to come at last to the
shelter of the brig Adventure, how strangely glad I was to
have brought off the girl from the mission.</p>

<p>And when we came up under the side of the brig and
saw honest Gideon North and all the others on deck looking
down at us, the girl let her paddle slide into the water
and bent her head on her hands and cried.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="small">THE CRUISER</span></h3>

<p>Matterson, Gleazen and the trader, Arnold, Abe and
I, and the white girl and her great black servant, all were
crowded into a frail dugout, which must long since have
foundered, but for the marvelous skill of the big Fantee
canoeman and the sureness and steadiness with which the
girl had wielded her paddle. And now the girl sat with
her face buried in her hands and her shoulders shaking as
she sobbed; and the big black, awed and frightened by the
nearness and strangeness of the good Adventure, was looking
up at the men who had crowded to the rail above him.
As the brig came into the wind and lay beside the canoe,
her yards sharply counter-braced, the long seas rose to
the gunwale of our heavily laden and waterlogged little
craft, and she slowly filled and settled.</p>

<p>We should have perished there and then, within an
arm's length of the solid planks that promised safety, had
not Gideon North acted promptly. As the canoe settled
and the water rose, I suddenly found myself swimming,
and gave the bottom of the canoe a kick and
plunged forward through the water to reach the girl and
hold her up. At the same moment, indistinctly through
the rush of the waves, I heard Captain North giving orders.
Then I saw Abe beside me, swimming on the same
errand, and heard someone spluttering and choking behind
me; then I came up beside the girl and, seizing one
slender wrist, drew her arm over my shoulder and swam
slowly by the brig.</p>

<p>There was no excitement or clamor. The canoe, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
emerged half full of water from those vast breakers on the
bar, yet having made out to ride the seas well enough
until the girl and the negro stopped paddling, had then
quietly submerged and left us all at once struggling in the
ocean.</p>

<p>Blocks creaked above us and oars splashed, and suddenly
I felt the girl lifted from my shoulders; then I myself
was dragged into a boat. Thus, after ten days on the
continent of Africa, ten such days of suffering and danger
that they were to live always as terrible nightmares in the
memory of those of us who survived them, we came home
to the swift vessel that had belonged to poor Seth Upham.</p>

<p>To the story that we told, first one talking, then another,
all of us excited and all of us, except Arnold Lamont,
who never lost his calm precision and the girl who
did not speak at all, fairly incoherent with emotion,
Gideon North replied scarcely a word.</p>

<p>"The black beasts!" Gleazen cried in a voice that
shook with rage. "I'd give my last chance of salvation to
send a broadside among them yonder."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's no great price," Matterson murmured
sourly. "I'd give more than that&mdash;many times more,
my friend. Think you, Captain North, that a man of
spirit would soon forget or forgive such a token as this?"
And he pointed at the raw wound the spear had left on
his face.</p>

<p>Gleazen stepped close beside him. "Hm! It's sloughing,"
he said.</p>

<p>"It's hot and it throbs like the devil," Matterson replied.</p>

<p>Arnold also came over to Matterson and looked at the
wound.</p>

<p>"It needs attention," he commented. "It certainly is
not healing as it should."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>Matterson raised his brows angrily. "Let it be," he
returned.</p>

<p>With a slight lift of his head, Arnold faced about and
walked slowly away.</p>

<p>As Matterson angrily glared from one of us to another,
the group separated and, turning, I saw our guest standing
silently apart.</p>

<p>"Captain North," I said slowly, "this lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not wait for me to finish.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am," he cried. "You shall
have my own stateroom. I should have spoken before,
but that sail troubles me."</p>

<p>Thereupon others turned to study the sail, which was
bearing down on us, although still some miles away; but
I continued to watch the guest whose presence there in the
Adventure seemed so strange as almost to savor of magic,
as she tried to thank Gideon North.</p>

<p>"Don't say a word," he cried. "Not a word! Remember
this: I've a wife and daughters of my own, and I wish
they were on board to make things comfortable for you.
But all we can do, I'm afraid, is give you a chance to make
yourself comfortable. Our cabin boy's gone. He went
ashore with those damnable villains yonder and never
came back."</p>

<p>"A little boy?" she suddenly asked.</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>"A wicked little rascal?" A strangely roguish light
flashed across her face and she smiled as if in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Gideon North's chuckle grew into a wide grin. "Ma'am,
that's Willie MacDougald to a T. But what do you know
of him?"</p>

<p>"He ran away from them, and came to us when they
had gone up-river, and said that they were going to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
him, and told a terrible story of the wrongs he had suffered.
But he could not abide our ways any more than
we his,&mdash;such a time as he led us with his swearing and
thieving and lying!&mdash;and when a boat from the American
cruiser came ashore while you were gone, he told the
men such a story of your search for slaves and of all your
gear and goods, they vowed to capture you if they lay off
the coast a year and a day, and they laughed at his
wretched oaths and made much of him and took him on
board. And then&mdash;then&mdash;" It seemed the thought of
all that had happened since swept upon her in a wave
almost as overwhelming as one of those breakers through
which we had fought our way; for she suddenly turned
white and tried to fight back her tears, and for the time
could speak no more.</p>

<p>"Come, Joe, look alive now!" Captain North roared,
trying to mask his kind heart and lively emotions with a
pretense of fierceness. "Fetch hot water from the galley
to my stateroom! Have the cook bring aft hot coffee and
a square meal. I'll take you below myself, ma'am, to
show you the way, and I now order you to help yourself
to all you need for comfort. Off with you, Joe!"</p>

<p>All this time the cook had been gaping from the galley
door at what had been going on aft; and so eager was he
to get a nearer view of the young lady who had come mysteriously
out with us from the river, and to gather up new
threads of the extraordinary story Abe Guptil had told
forward, that, although he was the laziest Yankee who
ever commanded a galley stove, he set out at a dead run
aft, with a coffee-pot in one hand and a pail of hot water,
which at every moment threatened to spill and scald him,
in the other.</p>

<p>Captain North at once came on deck again and found
the rest of us still intent on the approaching ship, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
with all her canvas spread was bearing down upon us like
a race-horse. The cook, on his way forward, paused to
survey her. The watch, now glancing anxiously aft, now
studying the stranger, was standing by for whatever orders
should be forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Arnold, "she means trouble."</p>

<p>"We've waited too long already," Captain North replied.
Raising the trumpet he cried, "Call up all hands,
there, Mr. Severance!"</p>

<p>A moment later he looked keenly at Matterson. "Mr.
Matterson," he said, "you are exhausted."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> a little peaked," Matterson said thoughtfully,
"a little peaked, but not exhausted."</p>

<p>"Will you take your station, sir?"</p>

<p>"I will." Still in his wet clothes and cautiously touching
his inflamed wound, Matterson went forward to the
forecastle. There was something soldierly in his promptness.
It was so evident that his strength was scarcely
equal to his task, that for his hardihood, little as I liked
him, I freely gave him credit.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleazen," said Captain North, "I am afraid we
must show her our heels."</p>

<p>"If I could lay my hands on the lean neck of William
MacDougald," Gleazen growled, "I'd wring his head
clean off."</p>

<p>"She unquestionably is bearing down on us."</p>

<p>"She is."</p>

<p>"And she knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She knows," cried Gleazen, "all that Willie MacDougald
can tell her of casks and farina and shackles and
lumber for extra decks."</p>

<p>"And of false papers with which you so carefully provided
yourself?"</p>

<p>Gideon North's face all this time was as sober as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
judge's, but now I saw that he was deliberately tormenting
Gleazen with the various preparations the man had
made for that unholy traffic in slaves.</p>

<p>Although Gleazen himself by now perceived it, his
wrath turned on our erstwhile cabin boy rather than on
Gideon North. He swore vilely. "Aye," he cried, "we
must run&mdash;run or hang. And all for the word of a prying,
cursing, eavesdropping young rooster that I might
have wrung the neck of, any day for months past. If ever
I lay hands on his ape's throat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gather, sir," Captain North dryly interposed,
"you'll use him harshly."</p>

<p>With that he turned his back on Gleazen and raised his
trumpet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lay aloft and loose the main to'g'l'ants'l.&mdash;Man the
to'g'lant sheets and halyards.&mdash;Some of you men, there,
stand by the clewl'nes and braces." For a moment he
stood, trumpet at lips, watching every motion of the men;
then, as those on the yards loosened the sail, he thundered,
"Let fall!&mdash;Lay in!&mdash;Sheet home!" Then,
"Hoist away!&mdash;Belay the halyards!"</p>

<p>As we crowded on sail, the brig leaned before the wind,
and for a time we hoped that we were gaining on the
stranger; but our hopes were soon dispelled.</p>

<p>It seemed queer to run from our own countrymen, but
run we did all that afternoon, through the bluest of blue
seas, with white clouds flying overhead and low lands on
the horizon.</p>

<p>In another sense I could not help feeling that Gideon
North himself showed quite too little anxiety about the
outcome of the race. Yet, as time passed, even his face
grew more serious, and all that afternoon, as we braced
the yards and so made or shortened sail as best to maintain
our speed at every change of wind, an anxious group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
watched from the quarter-deck of the Adventure the swift
vessel that stood after us and slowly gained on us, with
her canvas spread till she looked on the blue sea for all the
world like a silver cloud racing in the blue sky.</p>

<p>The nearer she came, the graver grew the faces about
me; for, if the full penalty of the law was exacted, to be
convicted as a slaver in those days was to be hanged, and
in all the world there was no place where a vessel and her
men were so sure to be suspected of slaving as in the very
waters where we were then sailing. The track of vessels
outward bound from America to Good Hope and the Far
East ran in general from somewhere about the Cape Verde
Islands to the southeastern coast of Brazil; that of vessels
homeward bound, from Good Hope northwest past St.
Helena and across the Equator. Thus the western coast
of Africa formed, with those two lines that vessels followed,
a rough triangle; and looking toward the apex, where the
two converged, it served as the base. In that triangle of
seas, as blue as sapphire and as clear, occurred horrors
such as all human history elsewhere can scarcely equal.
There a slaver would leave the lanes of commerce, run up
to the coast one night, and be gone the next with a cargo
of "ebony" under her hatches, to mingle with the ships
inward or outward bound; and there the cruisers hunted.</p>

<p>The faces of the crew were sober as the man-of-war,
cracking on every stitch of canvas, came slowly up to us
at the end of the afternoon. We all knew then that even
to keep a safe lead until sunset, it would do us precious
little good; for in a clear starlight night our pursuer could
follow us almost as well as by day. Arnold Lamont was
inscrutable; Gideon North was gravely silent; Matterson
and Gleazen were angry and sullen; and the luckless
trader, who had escaped from his ambushed caravan only
to find himself in a doomed vessel, was yellow with fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
There was not a man, forward or aft, who did not know
the incalculable stakes for which we were racing. Pedro
with his monkey on and off his shoulder as he worked,
Abe Guptil with his nervous, eager step, and all the others,
each showing the strain after his own manner, leaped to
the ropes at the word of command or fidgeted about the
decks in the occasional moments of inaction.</p>

<p>Of our passenger I had thought often and with ever
keener anxiety. How the fast-approaching end of our race
would affect her future I could only guess, and really I was
more anxious for her than for myself. But from the moment
she went below neither I nor any of the others saw
sign or glimpse of her, until, just at sunset, I ran thither
to fetch the leather-bound spyglass whose lower power
and greater illumination lent itself best to night work.</p>

<p>As I clattered down the companionway, I heard someone
dart out of the cabin. But when I entered, the girl, as
if she had been waiting to see who it was, came back
again, so eager for news from above that she could no
longer remain in hiding.</p>

<p>"Tell me, sir," she said, lifting her head proudly, "has
the cruiser overhauled us yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," I replied.</p>

<p>She stood as if waiting for whatever else I had to say;
but my tongue for the moment was tied.</p>

<p>"If they do?" she said as if to question me.</p>

<p>"Heaven help us!"</p>

<p>"Come," she cried with some asperity, "don't stand
there staring like a gaby! Tell me everything. Have not
I a right to know?"</p>

<p>"If you wish," I replied, stung by the scorn in her voice.
"The chances are that, if we are caught, some of us will
hang. Which of us and how many, is a debatable question."</p>

<p>She thought it over calmly. "That is probably true. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
think, however, that I shall have something to say about
which ones will hang."</p>

<p>That was a phase of the matter which had not occurred
to me. It gave me a good deal of relief, until I met her
eyes regarding me still scornfully, and realized what an
exhibition of myself I was making. I had been assertive
enough hitherto, and I had not lacked confidence where
females were concerned; I remembered well the one who
so long before had come into my uncle's store in Topham,
and how Arnold had smiled at the scorn that I had accorded
her. But this young lady somehow was different.
She had a fine, quiet dignity that seemed always to appraise
me with cool precision. She had shown, once at
least, a flash of humor that indicated how lightly, in less
tragic circumstances, she could take light things.  Now and
then she had dealt a keen thrust that cut me by its truth.</p>

<p>And yet she treated me kindly enough, too. She had
seemed almost glad to have me at her side when we ran
together from the mission.</p>

<p>"Mistress&mdash;" I began; then stopped and clumsily stammered,
"I&mdash;I don't know your name."</p>

<p>"My name?" With the hint of a smile, but with that
fine dignity which made me feel my awkwardness many
times over, she said, "I am Faith Parmenter."</p>

<p>Another pause followed, which embarrassed me still
more; then, awkwardly, I reached for the night glass.
Things were not happening at all as I had dreamed.</p>

<p>"You're long enough finding that glass," Captain North
growled when I handed it to him. "Aye, and red in the
face, too."</p>

<p>I was thankful indeed that the approach of the ship,
which had sailed so swiftly as to overhaul even our Baltimore
brig, gave him other things to think about.</p>

<p>By now the race was almost over. I heard Gleazen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
talking of bail&mdash;of judges&mdash;of bribes. I saw the man
Pedro twitching his fingers at his throat. I saw Arnold
Lamont and Gideon North watching the stranger intently,
minute after minute. Taking in our studding-sails
and royals, we braced sharp by the wind with our head to
westward. At that our pursuer, which had come up almost
abreast of us but a mile away, followed our example,
sail for sail and point for point, whereupon we hauled up
our courses, took in topgallant sails and jib, and tacked.</p>

<p>When the stranger followed our man&oelig;uvre, but with
the same sail that she had been carrying, she came near
enough for us to see that her lower-deck ports were triced
up. When we tacked offshore again, she hauled up her
mizzen staysail and stood for us; and fifteen minutes
later she hauled her jib down, braced her headsails to the
mast, and rounded to about half a cable's length to the
windward of us on our weather quarter. We had already
heard the roll of drums beating the men to their stations,
and now Captain North, his glass leveled at her in the
half light, cried gloomily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aye, the tampions are out of her guns already!"</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy!" came the deep hail. "What ship is that?"</p>

<p>"Train your guns, Captain North!" Gleazen cried
fiercely; "train your guns!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleazen," Gideon North retorted, with a stern
smile, "with one broadside she can blow us into splinters.
Our shot would no more than rattle on her planks."</p>

<p>"Ahoy there!" the deep voice roared, now angrily.</p>

<p>"The brig Adventure from Boston, bound on a legitimate
trading voyage to the Guinea coast," Captain North
replied. "Where are you from?"</p>

<p>To his question they returned no answer. The curt order
that the speaking-trumpet sent out to us was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Standby! We're sending a boat aboard."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>We were caught by a cruiser, and there was evidence
below that would send us, guilty and guiltless alike, to
the very gallows if the courts should impose on us the
extreme penalty.</p>

<p>Up to this point we had not been certain of the nationality
of our pursuers. Too often flags were used to suit
the purpose of the moment. But there was now no doubt
that the uniforms in the boat were those of our own
countrymen.</p>

<p>With long, hasty strides, Gleazen crossed the deck to the
captain. In his face defiance and despair were strangely
mingled. He was nervously working his hands. "Quick
now," he cried. "Haul down the flag, Captain North.
Break out the red and yellow. Throw over the papers.
Over with them, quick!"</p>

<p>"I am not sure I wish to change my registry," Gideon
North quietly returned.</p>

<p>Gleazen swore furiously. "You'll hang with the rest of
us," he cried,</p>

<p>"I think, sir, that I can <i>prove my</i> innocence."</p>

<p>"The casks and shackles will knot the rope round your
stiff neck. Aye, Captain North, you'll have a merry time
of it, twitching your toes against the sunrise."</p>

<p>In fury Gleazen spun on his heel. For once, as his teeth
pulled shreds of skin from his lips, the man was stark
white.</p>

<p>We heard the creak of blocks as the ship lowered her
boat, heard the splash of oars as the boat came forging
toward us, saw in the stern the bright bars of a lieutenant's
uniform.</p>

<p>There was not one of us who did not feel keenly the
suspense. So surely as the boat came aboard, just so
surely would the searchers, primed for their task, no doubt,
by that vengeful little wretch, MacDougald, find whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
damning evidence was stowed in the hold; and I was by
no means certain that, in the cold light of open court, we
who had fought against every suggestion of illegal traffic
could prove our innocence. But to Gleazen and Matterson
the boat promised more than search and seizure.
Whether or not the rest of us effected our acquittal, for
those two a long term in prison was the least that they
could expect, and the alternative caused even Gleazen's
nonchalance to fail him. It is one thing, and a very creditable
thing, to face without fear the prospect of an honest
death in a fair fight; it is quite another, calmly to anticipate
hanging.</p>

<p>Still Gleazen stood there in the fleeting twilight, opening
and closing his hands in indecision. Still Captain
North waited with folded arms, determined at any cost to
have the truth and the truth only told on board his brig.</p>

<p>The brig slowly rose, and fell, and rose, on the long seas.
The men stood singly and in little groups, waiting, breathless
with apprehension, for whatever was to happen. A
cable's length away, the cruising man-of-war, her ports
triced up, her guns run out and trained, rolled on the long
seas in time with the brig. We had thought, when we escaped
from the enfolding attack of the African war, that
all danger was over. Now, it seemed, we must face a new
danger, which menaced not only our lives, but our honor.</p>

<p>The boat now lay bumping under the gangway.</p>

<p>"Come, pass us a line!" the lieutenant cried.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gleazen woke from his indecision. Stepping
boldly to the rail, he called down in his big, gruff, assertive
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You men had better not come on board. Mind you,
I've given you fair warning."</p>

<p>"What's that you're saying?"</p>

<p>"You better not come on board. We've got four cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of smallpox already, and two more that I think are coming
down."</p>

<p>The men in the boat instantly shoved off, and a dozen
feet away sat talking in low voices. Obviously they were
undecided what to do.</p>

<p>To most of us Gleazen's cool, authoritative statement,
that the most dread plague of the African coast, the terror
alike of traders, cruisers, and slavers, had appeared among
us&mdash;a downright lie&mdash;was so amazing that we scarcely
knew what to make of it. I must confess that, little as I
liked the means that he took, I was well pleased at the
prospect of his gaining his end. But Gideon North, as he
had been prompt to shatter at the start Gleazen's first
attempt at fraud, promptly and unexpectedly thrust his
oar into this one.</p>

<p>"That, gentlemen, is not so," he called down to the
boat. "We have as clean a bill of health as any ship in
the service."</p>

<p>"Come, come, now," cried the young officer. "What's
all this?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you the truth, and I'm master of this
brig."</p>

<p>With his hands at his mouth Gleazen, half-pretending
to whisper, called, "We're humoring him. He won't admit
he has it. But what I've told you is God's honest truth."</p>

<p>Captain North started as if about to speak, then seemed
to think better of it. Folding his arms, he let the matter
stand.</p>

<p>I think he, as much as any of the rest of us, was relieved
when the boat, after hesitating a long time, during which
we suffered keenest anxiety, made about and returned to
the ship. Still we dared not breathe easily, lest the commanding
officer, refusing to accept his subordinate's report,
order a search at all costs. But five minutes later it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
appeared that, whatever their suspicions may have been,
they had no intention of running needless risks, for they
came about and made off up the coast.</p>

<p>Small wonder that they acted thus! The bravest of captains
must have stopped three times to think before ordering
his men to dare that terrible disease, the worst scourge
of those seas, the terror alike of slavers and cruisers, on
the bare word of such as Willie MacDougald that he would
find contraband.</p>

<p>I have often wondered whether Willie MacDougald was
on board the ship, and whether he was responsible for the
chase. In the light of all that I heard, I rather think he
was, although none of us who searched the decks of the
other vessel caught so much as a glimpse of him. But if so,
it must have disappointed him deeply that his revenge
failed to reach Cornelius Gleazen and Pedro's monkey;
and seeing the monkey, which had eluded its owner and
strayed aft, perched in the rigging and malevolently eyeing
Gleazen himself, I laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Then I saw that it was no time for laughing, for Gleazen
and Gideon North were standing grimly face to face, and
Arnold and Matterson and the trader were gathering close
around them.</p>

<p>Out of the rumble of angry voices, one came to me
more distinctly than any of the others:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleazen, it is time that we settled this question
once and for all. If you will come below with me, we can
reach, I am sure, a decision that will be best for all of us
in the Adventure."</p>

<p>It was Captain North who spoke. As he moved toward
the companionway, I saw that Arnold Lamont was beckoning
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<span class="small">A PASSAGE AT ARMS</span></h3>

<p>Across the cabin table was spread the big, inaccurate
chart of the west coast of Africa, on which Captain North
had penciled the rat-infested island and the river.</p>

<p>Seeing it now for the first time since he had returned to
the brig, Gleazen planted one finger on the picture of the
spot where we had found the wrecked ship with the
bones of the drowned slaves still chained to her timbers.
"Pfaw!" he growled. "If only <i>she</i> was afloat! There was
a ship for you! Given her at sea again, handsome and
handy, two good men would never 'a' lost their lives.
Given that she was not beyond repair, and we might yet
kedge her off and plank her and caulk her and rig her
anew."</p>

<p>"She's done," said Matterson languidly. "Forget her."
He laid his head on the table and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Molly!" There was a new note of concern in Gleazen's
voice. He leaned over and shook the man.</p>

<p>"Let me be," said Matterson.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," Gideon North interposed, "we are dodging
the issue."</p>

<p>"Well?" Gleazen angrily raised his head. "There is no
issue. We'll sail for the Rio Pongo, lay off and on till the
first dark night, then take the cargo that a friend of ours
will have ready. Thence, Captain North, we'll sail for
Cuba. <i>I'll</i> give the orders now, and <i>you'll</i> carry them out."</p>

<p>"How long," I cried hotly, "have you been giving orders
on board this vessel?"</p>

<p>He turned and glared at me. "If you want facts, Joe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
I'll give them to you: I've been giving orders aboard this
vessel from the day we sailed from Boston until now&mdash;aye,
and seeing that they were obeyed, too, you young
cub. But if you want fancies, such as are suitable for the
young, I've owned the brig only since Seth Upham went
mad and got himself killed."</p>

<p>"You own the brig?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I own the brig."</p>

<p>"You lie!"</p>

<p>That he merely laughed, enraged me more than if he
had hit me.</p>

<p>"You lie!" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Next," said he, "you'll be telling me that Seth Upham
owned her."</p>

<p>"That I will, indeed, and it is a small part of what I'll
be telling you."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't."</p>

<p>The man's effrontery left me without words to retort.</p>

<p>"He didn't," Gleazen said again. "Him and I went
into this deal share alike. Half to him and half to me and
my partners. Ain't he dead? Well, then I keep my half
and Molly, here, who is all the partner I've got left now,
gets the other half. Ain't that plain? Of course it is. It
would be plain enough if we'd got clear with the fortune
that was ours by rights. And because we lost the fortune,
it's all the plainer that we ought to get something for our
trouble."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Gleazen," Arnold interposed, "supposing
there were a grain of truth in what you say,&mdash;which
there isn't,&mdash;the rest of us, Joe and Abe and I, still have
a sixth part in it all."</p>

<p>"That," cried Matterson, bursting into the controversy
before Gleazen could find words to meet this new
argument, "that is stuff. The sixth part was to come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
of Seth Upham's lay; and Seth Upham is dead, so he gets
no lay. Therefore you get not a bit more than the wages
you signed on for; and if you signed on for no wages, you
get nothing."</p>

<p>"I can promise you, Matterson," Gideon North said
with a smile, "that nothing of that kind goes down under
my command."</p>

<p>"Then you're likely not to keep your command."</p>

<p>The trader, glancing shrewdly from one to another, had
edged over beside Gleazen, but now Arnold spoke, as ever,
calmly and precisely:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let all that go. About that we do not as yet care. It
is a matter to be argued when the time comes. But&mdash;what
will you take on board for a cargo at Rio Pongo?"</p>

<p>As if Arnold's question implied permission for him also
to have his say, the trader spread both hands in a gesture
of despair at such ignorance as it manifested.</p>

<p>"'What weel you get?' Ah, me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what will you get?" Arnold reiterated, quietly
smiling at the irony of his question.</p>

<p>"We'll get a cargo all right when we get there," Gleazen
asserted. "We'll let it go at that. Captain North, bring
the brig about on a course, say, of approximately west by
north." He bent over the chart. "That will be about
right. As for the wind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain North," said I, "you will do nothing of the
kind. Unless we can get an honest cargo, you will head
straight back to Boston and sell the Adventure for what
she'll bring."</p>

<p>"'What weel you get?'" the still amazed trader cried
again. "You weel get&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As for you, Joe,&mdash;" Gleazen momentarily drowned
out the man's voice,&mdash;"you'll get into trouble if you're
not careful."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>"For you, Mr. Gleazen, I don't care the snap of my
finger. I'll have my property handled in the way I
choose."</p>

<p>For a moment Gleazen glared at me in angry silence,
and in that moment, the trader found opportunity to
finish his sentence, which he did with an air of such pleasure
in the tidings he gave, and all the time so completely
unconscious of the subtler undercurrents of our quarrel,
that to an unprejudiced observer it would have been ludicrous
in the extreme.</p>

<p>"You weel get&mdash;<i>niggers</i>! Such prime, stout, strong
niggers! It ees a pleasure always to buy niggers at Rio
Pongo. Such barracoons! Such niggers!"</p>

<p>Although for a long time we had very well known the
hidden real object of Gleazen's return to Topham and of
the mad quest on which he had led us, this was the first
time that anyone had frankly put it into so many words.
The anger and defiance with which our two parties eyed
each other seemed moment by moment to grow more
intense.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no need to look so glum about it," said
Gleazen at last. "Half the deacons in New England live
on the proceeds of rum and notions, and they know well
enough what trade their goods are sold in. You may talk
all you will of the gospel; they take their dollars, when
their ships come home. Your Englishman may talk of his
cruisers on the coast and his laws that Parliament made
for him; but when the bills come back on London for his
Birmingham muskets and Liverpool lead and Manchester
cotton, he don't cry bad money and turn 'em down. Why,
then, should we? Where there's niggers, there'll be slaves.
It's in the blood of them."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," I retorted, "not a slave shall board
this vessel."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>"It appears," Gleazen slowly returned, "that this brig,
which is a small craft at best, is not big enough for both
of us."</p>

<p>"Not if you think you can give yourself the airs of an
owner."</p>

<p>"Hear that, you! 'Airs of an owner!' Well, I am owner,
I think&mdash;yes, I will give you a greater honor than you
deserve." Suddenly he leaned over and roared at me,
"Get down on your knees and apologize, or, so help me,
I'll strike you dead on the spot."</p>

<p>Quicker than a flash I reached out and slapped him on
the face&mdash;and as I did so I remembered the time when
O'Hara had slapped Seth Upham.</p>

<p>With his hand half drawn back as if to seize a chair for
a cudgel, he stopped, smiled, spun round and reached for
the pair of swords on the bulkhead. Extending the two
hilts, he smiled and said, "I shall take pleasure in running
you through, my friend."</p>

<p>"Not so fast!" It was Arnold who spoke. "I, sir, will
take first a turn at the swords with you."</p>

<p>"<i>In</i> your turn, Mr. Lamont," Gleazen retorted with an
exaggerated bow. "Meanwhile, if you please, you may
act as second to Mr. Woods."</p>

<p>"Come, enough of this nonsense," cried honest Gideon
North, "or I'll clap you both into irons. Dueling aboard
my vessel, indeed!" He looked appraisingly from one of
us to the other.</p>

<p>"I will fight him," I coolly replied.</p>

<p>"You will, will you?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Soberly Gideon North looked me in the eye. Already
Gleazen, Matterson, Arnold, and the others were moving
toward the companionway. This happened, you must remember,
in '27; dueling was not regarded then as it is now.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid, my boy, it will not be a fair fight."</p>

<p>"It will be fair enough," I replied.</p>

<p>Rising, Captain North brought out his medicine chest.</p>

<p>I followed the others on deck, as if the little world in
which I was moving were a world of unreality. All that I
knew of swordsmanship, I had learned from Cornelius
Gleazen himself; and though I felt that at the end of
our lessons I had learned enough to give him a hard fight, it
was quite another matter to cross swords that carried no
buttons, and to believe that one of us was to die.</p>

<p>There was only starlight on deck, and Captain North
stepped briskly forward to Arnold and Matterson, who
were standing together by a clear space that they had
paced off.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "if they were to wait until
morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There would be more light, to be sure," Arnold returned,
"but the disadvantage is common to both."</p>

<p>Gleazen grumbled something far down in his throat,
and I cried out that I would fight him then as well as any
time.</p>

<p>"If a couple of lanterns were slung from the rigging,"
Matterson suggested. He moved slowly and now and
then touched the hot skin around his wound; but although
it still troubled him, he appeared to be gaining
strength.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when two men
came running aft in response to Captain North's sharp
order. Lanterns were lighted and slung, and Cornelius
Gleazen and I, with sword in hand, faced each other across
a length of clean white deck.</p>

<p>It was a long way from friendly combat on the village
green at Topham to the bout I now waited to begin, and
both for Cornelius Gleazen and for myself the intervening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
months had piled up a formidable score to be settled.
Waiting in silence for our seconds, Arnold and Matterson,
to clear away some coiled ropes, we watched each other
with a bitter hate that had been growing on his part, I
am convinced, since the days when first he had seen me
working in my uncle's store, and on mine, certainly, ever
since I had become aware of the growing conviction that
the friendship he had so loudly professed for me was absolutely
insincere.</p>

<p>He had cheated, robbed, browbeaten, and, to all practical
ends, killed, my uncle. He stood there now, scheming
by every means in his power to kill and rob me in my
turn. And if he succeeded!&mdash;I thought of the girl to
whom Gideon North had given up his stateroom. How
much did she know of all that was going forward? There
had been only one door between her and the quarrel in
the cabin. And what fate would be left for her, if I should
fall&mdash;if Gleazen should override Gideon North and Arnold
Lamont? Truly, I thought, I must fight my best.</p>

<p>"And, sir," I heard Arnold saying, "if you are able to
bear arms after your bout with Mr. Woods, it is to be my
turn and you shall so favor me."</p>

<p>"That I will," Gleazen replied with a wry smile.</p>

<p>I know truly, although I do not understand the reason
for it, that after an unusually dramatic experience it is
likely to be some trifling, irrelevant little thing that one
remembers most vividly. And singularly enough it is a
tiny patch on Arnold's coat that I now most clearly recall
of all that happened then. I noticed it for the first time
when Arnold was speaking; I do not remember that I ever
noticed it again. Yet to this day I can see it as clearly as
if I had only to turn my head to find it once more before
my eyes, slightly darker than the body of the coat and
sewed on with small neat stitches.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Arnold was beside me. "Steady your blade, my
boy," he said. "Fence lightly and cautiously."</p>

<p>The two swords circled, flashing in the lantern-light,
and we came on guard in a duel such as few men have
fought. The rolling deck at best gave us unsteady footing.
As the lantern swung, the shadows changed in a way that
was most confusing. Now we were all but in darkness;
now the light was fairly in our eyes.</p>

<p>This, I thought, can never be the old Neil Gleazen with
whom I used to fence. He was craftier, warier, more cautious
now than I had ever seen him, and I took a lesson
from him and restrained the impetuousness of the attack
I should have launched had foils been our weapons. Now
he lunged out like a flash, and all but came in past my
guard. I instantly replied by a riposte, but failed to catch
him napping. Again he lunged and yet again, and for the
third time I succeeded in parrying, but all to no purpose
so far as opening the way for a counter-attack was concerned.</p>

<p>Now I saw the spectators only as black shadows standing
just out of the range of my vision. With every sense I
was alert to parry and lunge. Now it seemed very dark
except for the light of the lanterns, although before we
began to fence, the starlight had seemed uncommonly
bright and clear. The whole world appeared to grow dark
around me as I fought, until only Cornelius Gleazen was
to be seen, as if in the heart of a light cloud. Now I all
but eluded his guard. Now I drew blood from his arm&mdash;I
was convinced of it. I pressed him closer and closer and
got new confidence from seeing that he was breathing
harder than I.</p>

<p>For a moment,&mdash;it is a thing that happens when one
has concentrated his whole attention on a certain object
for so long a time that at last it inevitably wavers,&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
a moment I was aware of those around me as well as of the
man in front of me. I even heard their hard breathing,
their whispered encouragement. I saw that Matterson was
standing on my right, midway between me and Gleazen.
I saw a sudden opening, and thrusting out my arm, drove
my blade for it with all the speed and strength of my
body. That thrust, too, drew blood; there was no doubt
of it, for Gleazen gave a quick gasp and let his guard fall.
Victory was mine; I had beaten him. My heart leaped,
and lifting my sword-hand to turn off his blade, I attempted
a reprise. I knew by the frantic jerk of Gleazen's
guard that he was aware that I had beaten him. I was
absolutely sure of myself. But when I attempted to spring
back and launch the doubled attack something held my
foot.</p>

<p>I gave a quick jerk,&mdash;<i>literally my foot was held</i>,&mdash;I
lost my balance and all but went over. Then I felt a burning
in the back of my shoulder and sat down on deck with
the feeling that the lanterns were now expanding into
strange wide circles of light, now concentrating into tiny
coals of fire.</p>

<p>First I knew that Gideon North was bending over me
with his medicine chest; then I took a big swallow of
brandy and had hard work to keep from choking over it;
then I felt cool hands, so firm and small that I knew they
could belong to only one person in the Adventure; then
I saw Arnold Lamont, sword in hand, facing Cornelius
Gleazen.</p>

<p>Now why, I wondered, had I been unable to withdraw
my foot. Matterson had been all but in my way. He must
have thrust out his own foot!</p>

<p>"Arnold," I cried incoherently, "beware of Matterson!
He tripped me!"</p>

<p>Arnold looked down at me and smiled and nodded.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir," I heard him saying, as if miles away, "you have
beaten a man years younger than yourself by a foul and
treacherous trick. I shall kill you."</p>

<p>"Kill me?" Gleazen arrogantly roared. "It would take
a swordsman to do it."</p>

<p>To that Arnold replied in a foreign tongue, which even
then I knew must be Spanish. I was no competent witness
of what was taking place; but cloudy though my mind
was, I did not fail to see that Arnold's taunt struck home,
for both Gleazen and Matterson angrily swore.</p>

<p>"In Spanish, eh?" Gleazen sneered. "So this is the
leaky spigot! No more tales, my fine fellow, shall trickle
out through your round mouth, once I have measured
your vitals with cold steel."</p>

<p>Into my spinning brain there now came a sudden memory
of my bout with Arnold long, long ago, when I had
gone at him just as arrogantly as ever Neil Gleazen was
doing now. I tried to cry out again and could not. I
laughed, which was all my strength permitted, and wearily
leaned back, and through eyes that would almost
close in spite of me, saw Arnold advance under the
swinging lantern so swiftly that his sword was like a
beam of light flashed by a mirror.</p>

<p>His blade sped through Gleazen's guard: Gleazen
dropped his sword, staggered, and fell with a crash.</p>

<p>I heard Arnold say, "Sir, I am more clumsy than I
knew. The rolling deck has saved your miserable life,
since I cannot kill a wounded man. But if my hand were
in practice, no ship that ever rolled would have turned
that thrust."</p>

<p>Then a great uproar ensued, and I knew nothing more
until I opened my eyes in the cabin, where a hot argument
was evidently in progress, since oaths were bandied
back and forth and there were hard words on all sides.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"As representatives of Josiah Woods, who owns this
brig," I heard Arnold say, "Gideon North and I will not
permit you, sir, or any other man, to ship such a cargo."</p>

<p>The reply I did not understand, but I again heard Arnold's
voice, hot with anger.</p>

<p>"We will <i>not</i> sail again to that den of pirates and slavers
and the iniquitous of all the nations of the world,
Havana. If you do not wish to go to Boston,&mdash;" he hesitated,&mdash;"we
will use you better than you deserve. For
a profitable voyage, we might compromise, say, on South
America."</p>

<p>Of what followed I have no memory, for I was weaker
than I realized, from loss of blood. The cabin went white
before my eyes. The voices all dwindled away to remote
threads of sound. I seemed to feel myself sway with the
motion of the ship, and opened my eyes again and saw
that I was being carried. Then I once more felt cool hands
on my forehead, and leaning back, seemed to sink into endless
space. I forgot Topham and all that had happened
there; I forgot Africa and every event of our ill-fated
venture; I even forgot the brig and the duel, and I almost
forgot my own identity. But as I existed in a sort of dream-land
or fairyland somewhere between waking and sleeping,
I did not forget the girl who had come with me out of
Africa; and even when I could not remember my own
name, I would find myself struggling in a curiously detached
way to connect the name Faith, which persisted
in my memory, with a personality that likewise persisted,
yet that seemed a thing apart from all the world and not
even to be given a name.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXII<br />
<span class="small">WESTWARD BOUND</span></h3>

<p>At the time I did not know whether it was two days or
ten that I lay in that borderland of consciousness. But as
I emerged from it into a clearer, more real world, I saw
now the girl, now Arnold, now Gideon North, passing before
me and sometimes pausing by my berth. One day I
found myself eating broth that someone was feeding to
me. The next, I saw that the girl was my nurse. The next,
I asked questions, but so weakly that I could no more
than murmur a faint protest when she smiled and turned
away without answering.</p>

<p>So it went until a time when my voice was stronger and
I would not be put off again. Seizing her sleeve and feebly
holding it, I cried as stoutly as I was able, "Tell me&mdash;tell
me where we are and all that has happened."</p>

<p>What she saw through the open port, I could only
guess; if it was possible to judge by her face, she saw more
than mere sea and sky, with perhaps a wandering sea
bird; but she turned and quietly said, "We are at sea,
now, and all is going well, and when you are stronger, I'll
tell you more."</p>

<p>"Tell me now!" I demanded.</p>

<p>I would have said more, but I felt that my voice was
failing and I did not wish her to perceive it.</p>

<p>She hesitated, then impulsively turned.</p>

<p>"Just this: you are getting well fast, and he is getting
well slowly. We have gone from the coast and the Gulf
of Guinea, and are off for South America."</p>

<p>Then she went away and left me, and I was troubled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the sadness of her face, although she had had enough,
heaven knew! to make her sad.</p>

<p>"So," I thought, "we have really abandoned the trade
at last! And so Arnold brought down Gleazen! And
what of the trader and Pedro? And what are our prospects
of profit from a voyage to South America? And what of
Seth Upham and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then it all came back to me, a thousand memories
bursting all at once upon my bewildered brain, and I lived
again those days from the hour when I first saw Neil
Gleazen on the porch of the inn, through the mad night
when we left Topham behind us, through the terrible
seasickness of my first voyage, through the sinister adventure
in Havana, through all the uncanny warnings of
those African witch doctors, up to the very hour when
Seth Upham threw wide his arms and went, singing, down
to die by the spring. I remembered our wild flight, the
battle in the forest, the race down the river, the fall of the
mission, and again our flight,&mdash;the girl was with us now!&mdash;the
affair of the cruiser, the quarrel, the duel, and the
voices that I heard as I lay on deck. Then I came to a
black hiatus. Memory carried me no further and I wearily
closed my eyes, having no strength to keep them open
longer.</p>

<p>Next I knew that good Gideon North was standing over
me, his hand on my pulse; there was a sharp throbbing
pain in my shoulder where Gleazen's sword had struck
home; I was vaguely aware that the girl was sobbing.</p>

<p>Now why, I thought, should anything trouble her? It
was not as if she, like me, had come up against a wall that
she could not pass. I seemed actually to throw myself at
that black rigid barrier which cut me off from every event
that followed and&mdash;my delirious metaphors were sadly
mixed&mdash;left me balanced precariously on a tenuous column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
of memories that came to an end high up in a dark
open place, like the truck of a ship in a black, stormy night.</p>

<p>I heard Gideon North speaking of fever and my wound;
then the picture changed and the girl alone was sitting beside
me. She was singing in a low voice, and the song
soothed me. I did not try to follow the words; I simply
let the tune lead me whither it would. Then I went to
sleep again, and when I woke my memory had succeeded
in passing the barrier that before had balked every effort.</p>

<p>Now I remembered things that had happened while I
lay in my berth in my stateroom. I put together things
that had happened before and after my duel. It was as if
I reached out from my frail mast of memories and found
accustomed ropes and knew that I could go elsewhere at
will. I felt a sudden new confidence in my power to think
and speak, and when the girl once more appeared, I cried
out eagerly, even strongly, "Now I know what, who, and
where I am."</p>

<p>At my words she stepped quickly forward and laid her
hand on my forehead. The fever had gone. With a little
cry she turned, and I heard her say to someone in the
cabin, "His face is as cool as my own!"</p>

<p>In came Gideon North, then, and in the door appeared
Arnold.</p>

<p>"Bless me, boy!" Captain North cried, "you're on the
mend at last."</p>

<p>"I think I am," I returned. "What happened to me?"</p>

<p>"Happened to you? A touch of African fever, my lad,
on top of a dastardly stab."</p>

<p>"Where's Neil Gleazen?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's getting along better than he deserves. Our
friend Lamont, here, spitted him delicately; but he escaped
the fever and has had an easier time of it by far
than you, my lad."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>He once more counted my pulse. "Fine," he said in his
heartiest voice, "fine enough. Now turn over and rest."</p>

<p>"But I've been resting for days and days," I protested.
"I want to talk now and hear all the news."</p>

<p>"Not now, Joe. Well go away and leave you now.
But I'll have cook wring the neck of another chicken and
give your nurse, here, the meat. She has a better hand at
broth, Joe, my boy, than ever a man-cook had, and I'll
warrant, two hours from now, broth'll taste good to you."</p>

<p>So I went to sleep and woke to a saner, happier world.</p>

<p>In another week I was able to be up on deck and to lie
in the open air on cushions and blankets, where the warm
sunshine and the fair wind and the gentle motion of the
sea combined to soothe and restore me. It was good to
talk with Arnold and Captain North, and with Abe Guptil,
who, at my request, was ordered aft to spend an hour
with me one afternoon; but why, I wondered, did I see
so little now of Faith Parmenter?</p>

<p>She would nod at me with a smile and a word, and then
go away, perhaps to lean on the rail and watch for an hour
at a time the rolling blue sea, or to pace the deck as if
oblivious to all about her.</p>

<p>On that night at the mission weeks before, when neither
of us even knew the other's name, she had spoken to me
with a directness that had even more firmly stamped on
my memory her face as I had first seen it among the mangroves.
On that terrible day when her father had gone out
from the mission house to die, when dangers worse than
death had threatened us from every side, she had cast her
fortunes with Arnold's and with mine; in all the weeks of
my pain and fever, she had tended me with a gentleness
and thoughtfulness that had filled me with gratitude and
something more. But now she would give me only a nod
and a smile, with perhaps an occasional word!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>Why, Arnold and even old Gideon North got more of
her time and attention than did I. I would lie and watch
her leaning on the rail, the wind playing with stray tendrils
of her hair, which the sun turned to spun gold, and
would suffer a loneliness even deeper than that which I
felt when my own uncle, Seth Upham, died by the spring
on the side of the hill. Could there be someone else of
whom she was always thinking? Or something more intangible
and deeper rooted? More and more I had feared
it; now I believed it.</p>

<p>To see Cornelius Gleazen, his right arm still swathed in
many bandages and his face as white almost as marble,
eyeing me glumly from his place across the deck, was the
only other shadow on my convalescence. With not a word
for me,&mdash;or for my friends, for that matter,&mdash;he would
stroll about the deck in sullen anger, for which no one
could greatly blame him. He had no desire now to return
to our home town of Topham; his bolt there was shot.
We had refused him passage to the port of lawless men
where no doubt he could have plotted to win back the
brig and all that he had staked. Little grateful for the
compromise by which he gained the privilege of landing
on another continent, he kept company with his thoughts&mdash;ill
company they were!&mdash;and with Matterson. But
more than all else, it troubled me to see him watching
Faith Parmenter.</p>

<p>As I would lie there, I would see him staring at her, unconscious
that anyone was observing him. He would
keep it up for hours at a time, until I did not see how she&mdash;or
the others&mdash;could fail to notice it; yet apparently
no one did notice it. The man, I now learned, and it surprised
me, had a cat-like trick of dropping his eyes or
looking quickly away.</p>

<p>As I grew stronger, I would now and then stand beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
her, and we would talk of one thing and another; but without
fail there was the wall of reserve behind which I could
not go. She was always courteous; she always welcomed
me; yet she made her reserve so plain that I had no doubt
that it was kindness alone which led her to put up with
me. Only once in all that westward voyage did I feel that
she accepted me as more than the most casual of acquaintances,
and I could see, as I thought it over afterwards,
that even then it was because I had taken her by
surprise.</p>

<p>It came one night just when the sun was setting and the
moon was rising. The shadows on deck were long and of a
deep umber. The mellow light of early evening had washed
the decks and all the lower rigging in a soft brown, while
the topsails were still tinted with lavender and purple.
We were running before a southeast wind and&mdash;though I
incur the ridicule of old sailors by saying it&mdash;there was
something singularly personal and friendly about the seas
as they broke against our larboard quarter and swept by
us one by one. I know that I have never forgotten that
hour at the end of a fair day, with a fair wind blowing,
with strange colors and pleasant shadows playing over an
old brig, and with Faith Parmenter beside me leaning on
the taffrail.</p>

<p>We had been talking of trivial things, with intervals of
deep silence, as people will, especially in early evening,
when the beauty of the great world almost takes away the
power of speech. But at the end of a longer silence than
any that had gone before it, as I watched her slim fingers
moving noiselessly on the rail, I suddenly said, "Why do
you never tell me about your own life? In all this time
you have not let me know one thing about yourself."</p>

<p>As she looked up at me, there was a startled expression
in her eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you," she said, "wish to know more about me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She looked away again as if in doubt; then, with a little
gesture, which seemed for the time being to open a gate
in that wall of reserve which had so completely shut her
away from me, she smiled and spoke in a low, rather
hurried voice.</p>

<p>"My story is quickly told. I was born in a little town in
Dorset, and there I lived with my father and my mother
and nurse, until I was sixteen years old. My mother died
then. The years that followed were&mdash;lonely ones. It was
no surprise to me&mdash;to anyone&mdash;when my father decided
to give up his parish and sail for Africa. We all
knew, of course, how bad things were on the West Coast.
People said our English ships still kept up the wicked
trade. But they were ships from Brazil and the West
Indies, manned, I believe, by Spaniards and Portuguese,
that gave us the most trouble. There were Englishmen
and Americans now and then, but they were growing
fewer. We thought we were done with them; then you
came. Even after you had come, I told my father that you
were not in the trade; but my father already had seen
<i>him</i>,"&mdash;she moved her hand ever so slightly in the direction
of Gleazen, who likewise was leaning on the rail at a
little distance,&mdash;"and he would believe no good of you.
If only he could have lived! But you came. And here am
I, with only you and an old black servant."</p>

<p>She looked up at me with a sudden gesture of confidence
that made my heart leap.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came," she said.</p>

<p>Her hand lay on the rail beside mine, but so much
smaller than mine that I almost laughed. She turned
quickly with an answering smile, and impulsively I tried
to cover her small hand with my larger one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Deftly she moved her hand away. "Are you so silly?"
she gravely asked.</p>

<p>At that moment I was quite too shy and awkward for
my own peace of mind. She seemed suddenly to have
stepped away from me as on seven-league boots. I certainly
felt that she was angry with me, and I ventured no
more familiarities; yet actually she merely moved her
hand away and stayed where she was. There was that
about her which made me feel like a child who is ashamed
of being caught in some ridiculous game; and I think now
that in some ways I was truly very much of a child.</p>

<p>For a long time we watched in silence the rolling seas,
which had grown as black as jet save for the points of
light that they reflected from the stars, and save for the
broad bright path that led straight up to the full moon.
But when the moon had risen higher and had cast its cold
hard light on the deck of the brig, Cornelius Gleazen
edged closer to us along the rail.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she murmured in a very low voice, and
gave a little shudder, which, I divined, she intended that
I should see. Then, with a quick, half-concealed smile, she
left me.</p>

<p>All in all, I was happier that night than I had ever been
before, I believe, for I thought that we had razed the wall
of her reserve. But lo! in the morning it was there again,
higher and more unyielding than ever; and more firmly
than ever I was convinced that she had not told me <i>all</i>
her story; that there was someone else of whom she was
thinking, or that some other thing, of which I knew nothing,
preyed upon her.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
<span class="small">THE DOOR OF DISASTER</span></h3>

<p>On the morning when we sighted land, I saw the big
Fantee canoeman standing in the waist and looking with
eager eyes at the distant shore. I suppose it was because
I was still so weak that it did not thrill me as my first
glimpse of Africa had thrilled me. We had known for
some time that we were off the La Plata River by the
changed color of the water; but the shores that we now saw
were mere sandy beaches and low hills, which stretched,
Captain North said, from Cape St. Mary up the river itself;
and I, having somehow got the notion that I should
see grand cliffs and mountains, was sadly disappointed in
them.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock in the morning of that first day
we passed an island on which there were more seals than
I had ever seen in any one place; and at about eleven we
came to a small town, whence with light, fair winds we
continued on our way up the river toward Montevideo.</p>

<p>For our venture into unfamiliar waters we could not
have desired better weather than thus far prevailed; but
about sunset the wind rose and a dense fog blew in;
whereupon Captain North decided to haul off shore a few
miles and anchor for the night, which we did about fifteen
miles below the city. The wind, meanwhile, was rising to a
gale. At eight o'clock, as it was still rapidly increasing, we
paid out a considerable length of cable, and the Adventure
rode with much less straining than before; but Captain
North, I could see, was by no means well pleased with
our situation, and as we went below to supper I overheard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
him say to Matterson, who continued to hold the berth of
chief mate, "Tend the cable with care, Mr. Matterson, and
keep a good lookout."</p>

<p>Whatever Matterson's reply, I lost it; but to this day
I remember his giant figure as he stood there on the quarter-deck,
his jacket buttoned tight up to his throat, his
arms folded, with the wind racing past his gray stubble of a
beard. His strength was still impaired by his wound, although
at last it had healed clean; but there was no sign
of weakness in his bearing. In the dim light and the rising
gale he loomed up big, bold, and defiant.</p>

<p>Small wonder that I remember him as he looked then!
It was almost the last time I ever saw him.</p>

<p>We were five at the table that night,&mdash;Captain North,
Gleazen, Arnold, Faith, and I,&mdash;and Abe Guptil served
us as steward.</p>

<p>With Mr. Severance in his own quarters asleep during
his watch below, and with the trader whom we had rescued
sent unceremoniously forward to keep company with
the cook, we should have had a pleasant time of it but for
the presence of Gleazen, whose sullen scowl dampened
every word we spoke. Why the fellow ate with us instead
of waiting for Matterson, I am sure I do not know, unless
it was sheer perversity. Not one of us had a word to say
to him, yet there he sat, with his arm in a sling and the
folds of bandages showing through his waistcoat as broad
ridges, now glaring at Arnold, now eyeing Faith Parmenter;
and his few words could have brought little comfort
even to him.</p>

<p>"How she pitches!" Arnold exclaimed, as wine from his
glass fell in a red blot on the cloth.</p>

<p>"This wind," said Gleazen gloomily, "puts me in mind
of that little yell Seth Upham gave when they got him."
His voice sank almost to a whisper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as the brig plunged, Abe Guptil stumbled while
crossing the cabin and fell to his knees, yet made out by a
desperate effort both to hold his tray upright and to keep
the dishes from sliding off against the bulkhead.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Gideon North.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Abe replied, brightly, "that was a clever one
and I'm proud of it."</p>

<p>It had been impossible to teach him the manners of his
new work, but we cared little about that.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Faith. "What was the noise?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, so far as I know," Captain North replied.
"How she pitches and jumps!  Give me a ship under sail,
steadied by the wind abeam."</p>

<p>"I've heard Bud O'Hara use them very words," said
Gleazen.</p>

<p>Again silence followed the man's ill-chosen remark.</p>

<p>"When we have put our passengers ashore," Arnold began
with a significant glance at Gleazen, "shall we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain North!"</p>

<p>Matterson's light voice calling down the companionway
brought the old mariner to his feet.</p>

<p>Gleazen, who had seemed to be on the point of making
some ill-tempered retort, slumped back in his chair as Captain
North rose.</p>

<p>"What will you have, Mr. Matterson?"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come on deck, sir," came Matterson's
reply. "I'm in doubt whether or no we're drifting."</p>

<p>"Drifting?"</p>

<p>The old man went up with haste, and I followed close at
his heels.</p>

<p>"I don't like the feel of the lead," he remarked, when,
after gaining the deck, he laid hands on the lead-line.
"But what with the current of the river and our pitching,
I can't be sure. Are those breakers to leeward?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think, sir," Matterson replied, "that they are only
the white tops of the waves."</p>

<p>Matterson showed more genuine deference now than I
had ever seen in him before, which in itself went far to
convince me that affairs were going badly.</p>

<p>"They may be," the old man replied, "but I'm inclined
to doubt it." And with that he went aft over the
stern into the boat.</p>

<p>Evidently the nearer view convinced him that they
were indeed breakers, for he returned with surprising
agility.</p>

<p>"Call 'em up, Joe," he hoarsely cried, "every living
soul. We're in a bad way. You, Mr. Matterson, get ready
another anchor and send men to clear the cable tier below.
Quick now."</p>

<p>I heard those in the cabin start to their feet when I
called, and a moment later Gleazen burst out and up the
ladder. Behind him came Faith, whom he had passed in
his rush to the deck; then, a moment later, Arnold, who
had stopped to shake Mr. Severance out of a sound sleep.</p>

<p>The white crests were nearer now, and approaching at a
startling speed. The roar alone told us they were breakers.
A wave curled along the rail and a torrent of foam cascaded
over the bulwark, washed the length of the deck,
and eddied for a moment above the scuppers.</p>

<p>The breakers were upon us and all about us. Their deafening
roar drowned out every sound in the brig. Then we
struck. The man at the wheel was thrown to his knees, but
held his place. One or two men succeeded in clinging to
the rigging. The rest of us went tumbling up against the
rail.</p>

<p>I really did not understand the expression on Gleazen's
face. I simply could not yet comprehend the terrible danger
in which we were placed. To me, being no sailor, anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
would have seemed possible at sea; but now, when
we were so near port,&mdash;indeed, actually in sight of land,&mdash;it
seemed utterly incredible that we could be in deadly
peril. But it was a terrible lesson that put an end to my
folly. A second blow followed the first shock of our striking,
then a third still heavier, then a sea broke clean across
our bows, carrying one poor wretch overboard and driving
two more back to the quarter-deck. With a fearful,
despairing yell the luckless fellow went past us and down,
and as he did so I saw clinging to his shoulders a frightened
animal and knew that we had seen the last of Pedro
and his monkey.</p>

<p>The next sea broke over the whole weather side of the
good Adventure, and only by clinging fast to the rigging
did any one of us manage to retain his hold on the pounding
wreck, which, desperate though her plight was, represented
our one chance for life.</p>

<p>Now in a voice that rose above the roar of the tempest
Gideon North thundered, "Cut away the masts! Cut
away the masts!"</p>

<p>A lull followed, and for a moment we dared hope that,
once the brig was freed of all weight aloft, she would right
herself and go over the bar in such a way that we could let
go our anchor on the farther side and so bring her up again
into the wind. But the lull brought us only despair when
the carpenter answered him by shrieking at the top of his
voice, "The axe has gone overboard."</p>

<p>So swiftly and so mightily had the succession of seas
burst over us that of all hands only ten or a dozen were
left on board. I could see them in a line clinging precariously
to the weather-rail. At first, in dazed horror, I
thought Faith Parmenter was not there; then, seeing
someone drag her back through the wash of the sea, I myself
strove to reach her side. Another sea broke, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
she almost went overboard; then I saw that it was Abe
Guptil who was holding her with the strength of two men.
Then the great black figure of the Fantee canoeman worked
along the rail ahead of me and took a place beside her,
opposite to Abe, and helped to hold her in the brig.</p>

<p>It was plain to every one of us what the outcome would
have been had not a cross-current now thrown the pounding
hull at a new angle, so that for a breathing-space those
of us who were left alive had opportunity to take other
measures for safety. But the very wave that did that also
sent the masts by the board and, instead of lightening us,
cluttered the decks with a hopeless snarl of ropes and
canvas.</p>

<p>I was farther forward than the others, and so weak from
my long illness that for a moment I could only strive to recover
my strength and my breath. I saw them haul the
filled boat up to the stern and, by sheer strength and audacity,
raise her clear of the breakers, empty out half or two
thirds of the water and let her go back again into the sea,
where she rode sluggishly.</p>

<p>Into that rocking boat, first of all, sprang Matterson.
Close after him scrambled the craven trader, and after
him Neil Gleazen.</p>

<p>"Cast off!" I heard Matterson yell. "She'll founder
with another soul aboard her."</p>

<p>And off they cast, those three men, abandoning every
one of the rest of us to whatever end fate might hold in
store.</p>

<p>That they should leave behind them those of us who had
been from the first their enemies was not surprising; but
that they should abandon thus, on a wreck that we all
could see was doomed to break up in a few hours, if not
literally in a few minutes, a girl who had done them no
harm whatsoever, whose only fault lay in coming from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
quite another world than theirs, was contemptible beyond
belief, if for no other reason than that she was but a young
girl and they strong men.</p>

<p>I would not have believed it of even them. I could
scarcely believe my eyes when I saw them go. But as if to
deal them a punishment more fitting than any that we
could devise, while the brig was pounding in the breakers,
a wave, sweeping clean over her, wrenched the trysail
boom about and parted the sheet and flung the boom in a
wide half-circle squarely on top of the boat, which it
crushed to kindlings. Whether or not it hit any of the
three cowardly knaves a direct blow, it left them struggling
like so many rats in seas that speedily carried them out of
our sight into the darkness.</p>

<p>No doubt we should have seen more of their fate had
our own plight been less desperate; but the boom, as it
swung down on the boat, raked across the taffrail, and
those of us who had been clinging there in a long line, losing
our hold on what up to that point had represented to
us our only chance for safety, threw our arms round the
boom and clung fast to that and with it were swept away
from the wrecked brig, straight through the breakers that
foamed between us and the shore. Holding the boom itself
with one arm, I struggled to give Faith what help I
could with the other; but we must both have been washed
off the leaping spar, had not the big black Fantee canoeman,
who all this time had been working closer and closer
to his beloved mistress, plunged under the boom and, coming
up on the farther side, seized both her and me with a
grip like a gorilla's. Meanwhile Abe Guptil, as strong as a
bear, in a flash had seen how effective the Fantee's man&oelig;uvre
was, and had tried to duplicate it for himself,
Arnold, and Gideon North, who had been washed to the
farther end of the spar and nearly carried away from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
But he only partly succeeded, for to him the water was not
nearly so natural an element as to the mungo, and he
began his attempt later and completed it more slowly.</p>

<p>Coming up on the far side of the boom, gasping and
choking from a wave that struck him squarely in the face,
he clasped hands with Arnold and tried to do so with
Gideon North; but as his outstretched arm groped for him,
the sea tore the old sailor away and we five were left alone
on the long spar, two of us on one side and three on the
other, with arms and bodies locked around it.</p>

<p>Brave Gideon North! There was little time then to feel
his loss; but it was to grow upon us more and more and
more in the weeks and months to come. Stout-hearted,
downright, thoughtful, kind&mdash;it is very seldom that one
gets or loses such a friend.</p>

<p>The spar rolled and turned as it swept toward the shore.
Now we were pounded and battered and almost drowned
by the breakers; now we got a chance to breathe and regain
our strength as we came into deeper, quieter water;
now we were swept again through breakers that tossed us,
half drowned, into surging shallows. And so, holding fast
to one another, we were cast up on the shore in the darkness,
where we crawled away from the long waves that
licked over the wet sand, and sat down and watched and
waited and watched.</p>

<p>Twice we heard someone calling aloud, and once I was
sure that I saw someone struggling toward us out of the
surge. But though we staggered down to the sea and
shouted time and again, we got no answer. Slowly the conviction
forced itself upon us that we five and some half a
dozen sailors who had reached land before us were all who
were left alive of the passengers and crew of the brig
Adventure; that after all there was no hope whatever for
Gideon North, that bravest of master mariners.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>To such an end had come Cornelius Gleazen's golden
dreams! Through suffering and disaster, they had led him
to the ultimate wreck of every hope; his own catastrophe
had shattered the future of more than one innocent man,
and had caused directly the death of many innocent men.</p>

<p>It was a wild dawn that broke upon us on that foreign
shore. The wind raged and the sea thundered, and black,
low clouds raced over our heads. To watch by daylight
the terrible cauldron through which we had come by dark
was in itself a fearful thing; and beyond it, barely visible
through the surf, lay the broken hull of the Adventure.
So far as we could discover, there was no living creature
in all that waste of waters.</p>

<p>My dream of being a prosperous ship-owner lay wrecked
beside the shattered timbers of the Adventure; and knowing
that, after all my youthful dreams of affluence, I now
was a poor man with my way in the world to make, I felt
that still another dream, a dearer, more ambitious dream,
likewise was shattered.</p>

<p>If when I owned the brig and had good prospects Faith
Parmenter had withdrawn behind a wall of reserve, if there
had been someone else whom she held in greater favor,&mdash;of
whom she thought more often,&mdash;what hope that I
could win her now? Starting to walk away from the others,
I saw that she was ahead of me, staring with dark, tearless
eyes at the stormy sea. I stopped beside her.</p>

<p>"I suppose the time of our parting is near at hand," I
began. "If I can in any way be of service to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are going to leave me <i>now</i>? <i>Here?</i>"</p>

<p>There was something in her breathless, anxious voice
that brought my heart up into my throat.</p>

<p>"Not leave you, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the time of parting has come?" she said, with a
rising inflection. "It has found us in a wild and desolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
place,"&mdash;she smiled,&mdash;"more desolate and less wild than
the place from which we sailed. You came to me strangely,
sir; you go as strangely as you came."</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service to you," I blindly repeated,
"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Still smiling, she cut me short off. "I thank you, but I
think I shall be able, after all, to make shift. If someone&mdash;Mr.
Lamont, perhaps&mdash;will take me to some town where
there is&mdash;an English church&mdash;"</p>

<p>She still was smiling, but her smile wavered.</p>

<p>Could she, I wondered with a sort of fierce eagerness,
have told me <i>all</i> her story? Was there, then, really nothing
hidden?</p>

<p>"If you&mdash;" I began, "if I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she covered her face with her hands and sobbed,
and for the first time I dared guess the truth.</p>

<p>At what I then said,&mdash;the words that opened the gate
to the life we two have lived together,&mdash;she smiled so
brightly through her tears, that for the moment I forgot
the dark shore, the stormy seas, and the terrible, tragic
night through which we had passed.</p>

<p>There was a wealth of affection in Arnold's kind,
thoughtful face when we joined the others, and Abe Guptil
and the big Fantee, Paul, smiled at us&mdash;it was good
to see their smiles after the sufferings and sorrow that we
all had passed through.</p>

<p>"If only Gideon North and Seth Upham were here
now!" Abe cried.</p>

<p>"Poor Seth!" said Arnold. "What a price he has paid
for one passionate blow."</p>

<p>"What do you know?" I demanded.</p>

<p>Arnold gravely turned, "I <i>know</i> little," he said. "But
I have guessed much."</p>

<p>"What have you guessed?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>"They say in Topham that Neil Gleazen left town in the
night and Eli Norton was found dead in the morning."</p>

<p>While he paused, we waited in silence.</p>

<p>"That, my friends, is why Gleazen for twenty years did
not come back. But I once heard Gleazen say, when the
mood was on him to torment Seth Upham, let people
think what they would, that at least he&mdash;Gleazen&mdash;<i>knew</i>
who killed Eli Norton."</p>

<p>"And you think that Seth Upham&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted me with a Latin phrase&mdash;"De mortuis
nil nisi bonum."</p>

<p>My poor uncle!</p>

<p>"You four," said Arnold thoughtfully, "will need money
before you once more reach Topham."</p>

<p>"But of course you are coming too," I cried.</p>

<p>"No, I fear that I should not be content to live always
in Topham."</p>

<p>Taken aback by his words, I stared at him with an
amazement that was utterly incredulous.</p>

<p>"You are not coming back with us?"</p>

<p>"No." Arnold smiled kindly and perhaps a little sadly.</p>

<p>Unbuckling a belt that he had worn since I first knew
him, he drew it off and opened it, and I saw to my further
amazement that it was full of gold coins. "This," said
he, "will go far to pay your expenses."</p>

<p>"I cannot take gold from you," I cried.</p>

<p>"Do not be foolish, Joe. We are old friends, you and I,
and this by rights is as much yours as mine."</p>

<p>He thrust the belt into my hands. "It is all for you, but
there is enough for our good friend Abe, in case he parts
from you before reaching Topham."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have more. I am not, Joe, only that which I have
pretended to be in your uncle's store in Topham, where
you and I have had happy days together."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>At my bewildered face, he smiled again.</p>

<p>"My real name, Joe, is old and not obscure. I am one of
the least illustrious sons of my house; but I myself have
served on the staff of the great Bonaparte.</p>

<p>"And that&mdash;" I could scarcely believe that honest Arnold
Lamont was saying these astounding things.</p>

<p>"That is why it has been necessary&mdash;at least advisable&mdash;for
me to conceal for so many years my identity. A
man, Joe, does not tell all he knows."</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
<span class="small">AN OLD, OLD STORY</span></h3>

<p>It was spring when we came back to Topham. The sun
was warm upon the pleasant fields and gardens, and the
blossoms on the fruit trees were thick and fragrant. The
loveliest days of all the year were enfolding the pleasant
countryside of New England in the glory and peace of
their bright skies and soft colors; and as the hired coach
that brought us down from Boston, with black Paul, at
once proud and uncomfortable in a new suit of white man's
clothes, seated stiffly high beside the driver, rolled along
the familiar roads, I pointed out to my bride the fair
scenes among which my boyhood had been spent.</p>

<p>From Montevideo, which we reached on the evening
following the wreck,&mdash;there an old English clergyman
married us,&mdash;we had sailed to New York as passengers
in a merchant ship; but first we had taken leave of those
two good friends, Arnold Lamont, whom we were never to
see again, and Abe Guptil, who had bravely insisted on
setting out to build anew his fortunes by shipping as second
mate of an American bark then in port. From New
York a second ship had given us passage to Boston, whence
we came over the same road to Topham that I had traveled
so long before with Arnold and Sim and Abe and Neil
Gleazen and my uncle.</p>

<p>We ought, I suppose, to have been a properly anxious
young couple, for of the great sum in gold that Arnold had
so generously advanced us only a small part remained, and
what I should do in Topham, now that Uncle Seth's store
was in other hands, I had not the slightest notion. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
tower of golden dreams that poor Seth Upham had built
in idle moments had fallen into dust; Neil Gleazen's unscrupulous
quest had brought only ashes and bitterness;
it was from the shadow of a great tragedy that we came
into that golden morning in spring. But great as had been
those things that Faith and I had lost, we had gained
something so deep and so great that even then, when in
discovering it we were so happy that the world seemed too
good to be real, we had not more than begun to appreciate
the wonder and magnitude of it.</p>

<p>Thus I came back to Topham after such a year and a
half as few men have known, even though they have lived
a full century&mdash;back to Topham, with all my golden
prospects shattered by Gleazen's mad adventure, but with
a treasure such that, if all the gold in the world had been
mine, I would eagerly have given every coin to win it.</p>

<p>With my bride beside me, her hand upon my arm, I
rode into sleepy little Topham, past my uncle's house
where I had lived for many happy years, past the store
where Arnold and poor Sim Muzzy and I had worked together,
past the smithy where even now that old prophet,
the blacksmith, was peering out to see who went by in the
strange coach, and after all was failing to recognize me at
the distance, so changed was I by all that had befallen
me, up to the door of the very tavern where I had first
seen Cornelius Gleazen.</p>

<p>There I handed my dear wife down from her seat in the
coach, dressed in a simple gown and bonnet that became
her charmingly, and turned and saw, waiting to greet me,
the very landlord whom last I had seen reeling back from
Gleazen's drunken thrust.</p>

<p>At first, when he looked at me, he showed that he was
puzzled; then he recognized me and his face changed.</p>

<p>My fears lest the good man bear me a grudge for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
share, small though it was, in that villainous night's work,
vanished there and then. "You!" he cried, with both
hands outstretched; "why, Joe! why, Joe! We thought
you were long since lost at sea or killed by buccaneers&mdash;such
a story as Sim Muzzy told us!"</p>

<p>"Sim Muzzy?" I cried. "Not Sim!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sim!"</p>

<p>Then I heard far down the road someone calling, and
turned and saw&mdash;it was so good that I rubbed my eyes
like a child waking from a dream!&mdash;actually saw Sim
Muzzy come puffing and sweating along, with a cloud of
dust trailing for a hundred yards behind him.</p>

<p>"Joe, Joe," he cried, "welcome home! Welcome home,
Joe Woods!"</p>

<p>And as I am an honest man, he fell to blubbering on the
spot.</p>

<p>"Things are not what they used to be," he managed at
last to say. "The new man in the store don't like the
town and the townspeople don't like him, and I've been
living in hopes Seth Upham would come home and take it
off his hands. But who is this has come back with you,
Joe, and what's come of Seth Upham?"</p>

<p>At that I presented him to my wife, who received him
with a sweet dignity that won his deepest regard on the
spot; and then I told him the whole sad story of our adventures,
or as much of it, at least, as I could cram into
the few minutes that we stood by the road.</p>

<p>"And so," I concluded, "I have come back to Topham
with not a penny to my name, save such few as are left
from Arnold's bounty."</p>

<p>Sim heard me out in silence, for evidently his own trials
had done much to cure him of his garrulity, and with
a very sad face indeed he stood looking back over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
village where we had lived and worked so long together.</p>

<p>"Poor Seth Upham!" he said at last. "Well, there's
nothing we can do for him now. And as for Neil Gleazen,
he's better dead than back in Topham, for here he'd
hang as sure as preaching. Jed Matthews, they say, never
moved a muscle after Neil hit him on the head. But as for
you, Joe, you're no penniless wanderer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There was all of fifteen thousand dollars on board the
brig."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I help Seth store it in his trunk? 'You're
simple, Sim, and honest,' he says to me. 'I'll not have another
soul besides you know this, but you're as honest as
you are simple,' Them's the words he said, and I was
that proud of 'em that I've treasured 'em ever since."</p>

<p>I thought of the papers and bags we had stored in the
wagon that night when we fled from Topham.</p>

<p>"He hid it well," I replied. "But even if he had not
hidden it so well, I fear that it would nevertheless be at the
bottom of the La Plata River, just as it now is, with the
brig, and all the goods that were on board her, and many
men that sailed in her, good and bad alike."</p>

<p>"But that is not all."</p>

<p>"Not all? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Seth Upham left money in the bank, and I've seen
his will with my own eyes. 'Twas found in the safe after
we left town, and turned over to Judge Fuller."</p>

<p>"But surely, what with buying the brig and taking all
his papers, which I looked over myself in the cabin of the
Adventure and which were lost, every one, when she
broke up, he had nothing left. Why, the brig must have
cost a pretty penny."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"That may well be, Joe, but there's money in the bank,
for all that. Seth Upham had more money tucked away
than most people would have believed."</p>

<p>I thought this over with growing wonder. "I do believe,
my love," I said, "that we shall be able to make a
fair start in the world after all, and, which is more, repay
certain debts at once."</p>

<p>Faith smiled as she looked up at me; then she turned
and looked at the quaint old town, which was spread before
us in the sun.</p>

<h3 class="p4">CHAPTER XXXV<br />
<span class="small">EHEU FUGACES!</span></h3>

<p>Sim Muzzy's tale, when he bethought himself to tell
it to us, was a lively one in its own way, although it did
not, of course, compare with our African adventures. The
press-gang that set upon us in Havana had rushed him
away to a Spanish ship, where he was kicked about and
cruelly abused, until, at peril of his life, he dropped overboard
in the dark and swam to an American schooner,
whose captain, hearing his story, took him on board and
hid him in the chain-locker until they were well on their
way to Boston. Thence Sim had set out on foot for Topham,
where he had hired himself once again to tend the
store and had led a dog's life ever since.</p>

<p>That Sim was right about Uncle Seth's bank accounts
and his will, which left all to me, I learned before sunset
that very day. The sums were not large in themselves, and
taken all together they were small enough compared with
the golden dreams my poor uncle had lived in; but they
assured Faith and me of comfort at least; and when that
evening I called upon the new storekeeper and found him
so eager to escape from a town where his short measures
and petty deceits had made him unpopular and discontented,
that he was not in the mood to haggle over the
bargain, I bought back the store on the spot.</p>

<p>"There'll be happier days ahead, Sim," said I when I
came out.</p>

<p>"O Joe, I'm sure of that," he replied, his face bright
with smiles; for he had overheard considerable of our discussion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the week the papers were signed, and before a
fortnight was up Faith and I went out, arm-in-arm, on
the old hill road and saw the men break ground for the new
house that we were to build.</p>

<p>Whether any of the others, unknown to Faith and me,
had made their way ashore on the night of the wreck, we
never learned; but it was virtually impossible that they
should have done so without revealing themselves to those
of us who had ranged all that bleak coast the next morning.
For honest Gideon North we mourned as for one of the
dearest of friends, and of the rest we thought sometimes
in the years that followed. But none of them, except our
own Abe, ever came to Topham, nor did I ever go back
to the sea.</p>

<p>Three letters at long intervals brought us news of Arnold
Lamont; and to the address that he gave in the first
we sent with our reply a draft for the sum that he had so
generously lent us when on that wild South American
shore we four had set out to begin life anew. They were
good letters, and there was no note of complaint in them;
yet as I read them and thought of the Arnold Lamont
whom I had known so long and, all things considered, so
intimately, I could not but feel that in the cities of South
America and, later, of Europe he failed, whatever compensations
there may have been, to find anything like the
peace and quiet happiness that he once had found in our
New England town of Topham.</p>

<p>The week before the walls of our new house were raised,
Faith and I drove together along a road that I had tramped
on an autumn afternoon, to the farm where Abe Guptil
had lived in the days that now seemed so long ago. We
carried with us certain papers, which changed hands in the
kitchen where Abe and his little family had slept the night
when I was their guest; and so it happened that, when Abe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
returned from his voyage and came to see me at the store
full of honest joy at my good fortune, I sent him off to
his own old home with the assurance that the terms by
which he was to buy it were such that he need never fear
again to lose it.</p>

<p>As the town of Topham has grown around us, Faith and
I have grown into the town and with it; and although the
black Fantee, Paul, who remained the most faithful of servants,
was a nine days' wonder in the village, there now
are few people left, I imagine, who know all the wild, well-nigh
unbelievable, yet absolutely true, story of the year
when we first met. A royal fortune may have been lost
with Seth Upham and Neil Gleazen in Gleazen's mad
quest, but I can say in all sincerity that from his quest I
gained a fortune far beyond my deserts.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
